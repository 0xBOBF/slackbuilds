Museek+ is a file-sharing application for the Soulseek peer-to-peer network,
written in C++. It's an enhanced version of Hyriand's original Museek
(see http://museek.thegraveyard.org). It supports chat, transferring files,
searching, user-management, shares browsing and more. The new features are:
room searching, interests, buddy-only shares, banlists, icon themes and 
font/color selecting.

Museek+ consists of museekd (daemon), muscan (shares scanning tool), muscand
(automated shares scanning tool), musetup (command-line configuration script),
musetup-gtk (PyGTK configuration app), museeq (QT GUI client), mucous (curses
python client) and museekcontrol (command-line python client).

After installing museek+ follow these steps:

1) Configure your settings with musetup: server, username, password, interface
   password, download directory, shared directories.
2) Run museekd.
3) Run museeq, mucous or museekcontrol.
4) Login into museekd via the interface socket or host:port and the interface
   password.

Requires: scons, libsig++ and libxml++. Optional requirements are PyGTK 
(for musetup-gtk) and gamin (for muscand). Slackbuilds for all the requirements
are available at slackbuilds.org.

An example init script (rc.museekd) for the museekd daemon is provided. Feel 
free to modify it for your needs. Use it at your own risk.

Note for compiling on -current: You will have to change the name of the CFLAGS
variable to FLAGS and apply a second patch -museek-scons-current.patch.
