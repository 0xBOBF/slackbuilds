# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

tdb: tdb (Trivial Database)
tdb: 
tdb: tdb is a Trivial Database. In concept, it is very much like GDBM,
tdb: and BSD's DB except that it allows multiple simultaneous writers and
tdb: uses locking internally to keep writers from trampling on each other.
tdb: TDB is also extremely small.
