WordNetÂ® is a large lexical database of English, developed under the
direction of George A. Miller. Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are
grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a
distinct concept. Synsets are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic
and lexical relations. The resulting network of meaningfully related words
and concepts can be navigated with the browser. WordNet is also freely
and publicly available for download.  WordNet's structure makes it a
useful tool for computational linguistics and natural language processing.

WordNet requires Tcl/Tk, which is included with Slackware 12.1.

Since this package does not install to the default location, the WordNet
browser (wnb) requires the enviornmental variable WNHOME=/usr to be set,
so that it can find the database files. To do this for bash, you can add
"export WNHOME=/usr" to the end of ~/.bashrc, without the quotes.
