Clearsilver is a fast, powerful, and language-neutral template system
meant primarly for html.

In both static content sites and dynamic HTML applications, it
provides a separation between presentation code and application logic
which makes working with your project easier.

clearsilver.Slackbuild requires that PERL and Python be installed.
