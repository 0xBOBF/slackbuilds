Phalanx is a free chess engine which understands the xboard
protocol. It's suitable for beginner and intermediate
players. Phalanx's playing style is quite human-like; when it plays at
full strength, it may be compared to a intermediate-to-strong club
player; beginners will be right at home with it, too.

This SlackBuild comes with a patch from Scid <scid.sourceforge.net> by
Pascal Georges, because this package is primary intended to be used
with scid. If you don't want the patch, simply remove "setboard.patch"
from the patches directory.
