Kdissert

Kdissert is a mindmapping-like tool to help students to produce complicated 
documents very quickly and efficiently : presentations, dissertations, 
thesis, reports. While targetted mostly at students, Kdissert can also help 
teachers, decision maker, engineers and businessmen.

Though this application shares some similarities with general-purpose 
mindmapping tools like Freemind or Vym, the very first goal of Kdissert is 
to create general-purpose documents, not mind-maps.

The goal of Kdissert is to help to structure ideas and concepts. Ideas are 
first layed down on a canvas and then associated into a tree. The tree is there 
to help to see how the ideas interact, and then to develop them further (by 
adding ramifications).

An idea is represented by a shape which contains several a summary (visible 
part), several text fields, and optional pictures and url links.

A kdissert mind-map can be used to generate documents, or to create pictures. 
The current generators are pdf documents (based on LaTeX : article, book), 
pdf presentations (based on LaTeX : Beamer, Prosper), text processing 
files (OpenOffice.org Writer), plain text and internet documents (html).
