davfs2 (WebDAV Linux File System)
 
davfs2 is a Linux file system driver that allows you to mount a WebDAV
server as a local file system, like a disk drive. This way 
applications can access resources on a Web server without knowing 
anything about HTTP or WebDAV.  Davfs2 runs as a daemon in userspace.
It uses the kernel file system fuse (or coda, but fuse is in Slack 
12.1 kernel).  To connect to the WebDAV server it makes use of the
neon library. Neon supports TLS/SSL using OpenSSL(or GnuTLS, but 
Slack has OpenSSL) and access via proxy server.

Dependencies are: neon (neon-0.26.4 is included in Slack 12.1)
