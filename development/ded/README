ded allows you to navigate through multiple file lists or a directory
tree, viewing or changing file attributes rapidly. In addition to
conventional file information, it operates on the file's RCS or SCCS
archives, making it useful for source-control as well as system
administration. Curses-based, it runs on UNIX systems.

td_lib (available from SlackBuilds.org) is required to build this. Note
that you do not need to actually 'installpkg' td_lib if you do not want
to. It only needs to be built and when ded is built alongside it, ded
will find it. You can then remove the td_lib directories and package if
you don't want them.
