kdesvn is client for subversion. It uses native KDE API instead of a 
extra lib like GAMBAS and it is using the native subversion 
delevelopment API instead of just parsing the output of the 
commandline tool like most other clients do.

It tries to setup a look and feel like the standard filemanager of
KDE and is integrated into it via KPart.
