Miro is a free Internet television application for the online
Democracy Network.

Requires Boost, gst-python, and gnome-python-extras.

Optional dependencies are libtorrent-rasterbar and notify-python.
Miro comes with libtorrent-rasterbar 0.14.2 and will not interfere
with libtorrent-rasterbar if installed later.

See README.runtime for addtional runtime requirements.

Note:
The Miro slackbuild aborts when trying to look at the pm-utils.pc file.
This sed statement corrects the syntax error if it sees it in the
pm-utils.pc file.  If you haven't fixed it yet, then your welcome!!! :-)

sed -i 's|)|}|' /usr/lib/pkgconfig/pm-utils.pc 2>/dev/null
