gaphas (GTK+ based diagramming widget)

Gaphas is a MVC canvas that uses Cairo for rendering.  One of the
nicer things of this widget is that the user (model) is not bothered
with bounding box calculations: this is all done through Cairo.

This requires decorator and simplegeneric.

To build, this requires pysetuptools and setuptools_git.
