SFML is a portable and easy to use multimedia API written in C++. You can
see it as a modern, object-oriented alternative to SDL.  SFML is composed
of several packages to perfectly suit your needs. You can use SFML as a
minimal windowing system to interface with OpenGL, or as a fully-featured
multimedia library for building games or interactive programs.'

Main features:
* Portable
  SFML compiles on standard platforms like Windows (98, 2000, XP, Vista)
  and Unix systems (Linux, Mac OS X). As the library grows up, support
  for more operating systems will be added.
* Object-oriented
  SFML is written in C++ and provides an efficient, object-oriented
  design. It relies on standard patterns and idioms to provide a simple
  and robust framework.
* Easy to use
  SFML aims at being easy to manipulate. Effort is put on internal code
  to provide the simplest public interface.
* Flexible
  Instead of being one big API, SFML rather contains a lot of small
  packages, that can be chosen and combined according to the intended
  usage. You can use only the base package to get input and windowing,
  as well as the full graphics package with sprites and post-effects.
* Easily integrable
  SFML can be used in one or more windows, and/or can be integrated in
  existing interface components. Integration with existing graphical user
  interface (GUI) libraries is easy, so that you can add SFML views into
  complex interfaces built with Qt, wxWidgets, MFC or whatever.

SFML is available in the following languages:
* C++
* C
* .Net (C#, VB.Net, C++/CLI, ...)
* Python
* D
* Ruby

This requires OpenAL and libsndfile.
