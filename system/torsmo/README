Torsmo is a system monitor for Linux that sits in the corner of your
desktop. Torsmo renders itself on the root window (on the desktop) or
to its own transparent window any special eyecandy.  Among other
things, it can display information about your kernel version, uptime,
system time, NIC info, hostname, temperatures, battery info, process
information, local mail, and filesystem statistics.
