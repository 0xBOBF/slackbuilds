Pivy is a Python binding for Coin where the interface is implemented
using SWIG.

Pivy allows:
  * development of Coin applications in Python
  * interactive modification of Coin programs from within the Python
    interpreter at runtime
  * incorporation of Scripting Nodes into the scene graph which are
    capable of executing Python code and callback functions

This script is tested using the svn code from 20081227, and this is
the tarball hosted on our site. You may elect to use this source code
to build the package, or you can pull the latest from their subversion
repository as indicated below.

If you want to use the latest subversion source when building your
Pivy package, you will need to get it from their svn server.  To get
the source code, you can use the included "Pivy-mksrctarball.sh"
script, which will to download the source code and create a compressed
tarball of it using the date (date +"%Y%m%d") as its version string.

If you have already Pivy's source code as a tarball, for example:
Pivy-20081227.tar.bz2
You can tell the build script to use it with the following command:
VERSION=20081227 ./Pivy.SlackBuild
Note that this is the version that will be used by default unless you
specify otherwise.

Pivy package depends on Coin and SWIG packages, both available from
SlackBuilds.org.
