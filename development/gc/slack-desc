gc: Boehm-Demers-Weiser garbage collector
gc: 
gc: The Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector can be used as a 
gc: garbage collecting replacement for C malloc or C++ new. It allows you to 
gc: allocate memory basically as you normally would, without explicitly 
gc: deallocating memory that is no longer useful. The collector automatically 
gc: recycles memory when it determines that it can no longer be otherwise 
gc: accessed.
