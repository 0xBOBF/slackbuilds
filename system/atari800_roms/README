The operating system and BASIC language ROM images from the
Atari 800 and 800XL computers.  The ROM images are installed in
/usr/share/atari800/atari_roms, for use with the atari800 emulator,
but may be used with other emulators such as Atari++.

Also included are bootable disk images for Atari DOS 2.5 and MyDOS 4.5d,
and a couple of disks of demo software. These are installed in
/usr/share/atari800/disks

These ROM images are proprietary and copyrighted, but have been widely
available on the Internet for over 10 years. By installing this package,
you may be violating copyright laws in your jurisdiction, but nobody
has ever been sued or threatened for using these images.  If you want
to use an Open Source Atari OS instead, install the atari800_os++ package.

If you have the SlackBuilds.org atari800_roms and atari800_os++ packages
installed, you can adjust the symlink at /usr/share/atari800/atarixl.rom
to choose which OS will run (or, edit ~/.atari800.cfg, or run atari800
with the -xlxe_rom option).
