The NTFS-3G driver is an open source, freely available NTFS driver
for Linux with read and write support. It provides safe and fast
handling of the Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows 2000 and
Windows Vista file systems. Most POSIX file system operations are
supported, with the exception of full file ownership and access
right support.

This package requires FUSE 2.6.0 or later to guarantee full data
safety, for which a build script is available from SlackBuilds.org.
