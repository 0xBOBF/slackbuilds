Qwt is an extension to the Qt GUI library from Troll Tech AS.  
The Qwt library contains widgets and components which are 
primarily useful for technical and scientifical purposes.
It includes a 2-D plotting widget, different kinds of sliders, 
and much more.

NOTE: when building with qt3, using TMP=/tmp/SBo is strongly recommended.
Using symlinks or a TMP in /usr/* will lead to the application installing 
files directly onto the system as opposed to the package DESTDIR.
