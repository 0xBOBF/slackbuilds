PrBoom is a modern doom game engine or "doom-port" to play idSoftware's Doom, 
Doom II, Doom expansion packs and custom "iwads" or mods (It doesn't include 
the game itself).It aims to be the most stable Doom port with the highest 
compatibility to the major Doom versions. 

If you don't own any of the Doom games, get the shareware doom1.wad from 
http://www.libsdl.org/projects/doom/data/doom1.wad.zip or google for it. 
Remember to rename it to lowercase: mv DOOM1.WAD doom1.wad Then copy 
doom1.wad to /usr/share/games/doom/

If you have one or all of the main Doom data files from idSoftware - 
either doom.wad, doom2.wad, tnt.wad or plutonia.wad from one of the 
commercial Doom games copy them there too.

Requirements: sdl (SDL_mixer, SDL_net, all included in the sdl-1.2.* 
package in slackware/l series)

Highly recommended: Get the timidity.tar.gz from the SDL_mixer page 
http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/timidity/timidity.tar.gz (14M) 
and extract in /usr/lib/ for the great game music.

Suggested: Take a look at the docs, man pages or visit BahdKo at 
http://www.doom2.net to learn how to watch demos, info, files, etc. 
A great help for newcomers. (You may need a proxy to visit this url)
