quassel is a cross-platform IRC client built on qt4.  quassel core connects 
to servers and quassel client connects to quassel core over the internet.  
It means you can retain your IRC sessions even if you exit your X session.
Multiple clients can attach to and detach from a central core.  It's like a 
combination of GNU screen with such console IRC clients as weechat and irssi.
