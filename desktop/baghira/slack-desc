# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

baghira: baghira (A native theme/style for KDE 3.5+)
baghira:
baghira: Baghira is a style package for KDE 3.2+ that resembles nearly the 
baghira: entire Mac OS X user interface in detail. When the correct settings 
baghira: are made, and the right tools are used, the KDE desktop can look like 
baghira: a real Mac OS X desktop. The name refers to the Panther of Kipling's 
baghira: famous baghira: Jungle Book (German spelling). You will probably 
baghira: rather know the Disney version. Basically it's a perky imitation of 
baghira: Apple's OSX look
