monsterz: The goal of the game is to create rows of similar monsters, either
monsterz: horizontally or vertically. The only allowed move is the swap of two
monsterz: adjacent monsters, on the condition that it creates a row of three or
monsterz: more. When alignments are cleared, pieces fall from the top of the
monsterz: screen to fill the board again. Chain reactions earn you even more
monsterz: points.
