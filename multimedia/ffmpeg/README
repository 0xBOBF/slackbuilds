FFmpeg is a complete solution to record, convert and stream audio
and video. It includes libavcodec, the leading audio/video codec
library.

If you want to use the latest subversion source when building your
ffmpeg package, you will need to get it from their svn server.
To get the source code, you can use the included "ffmpeg-mksrctarball.sh"
script, which will to download the source code and create a compressed
tarball of it using the date (date +"%Y%m%d") as its version string.

ffmpeg requires the following, all of which are available at SlackBuilds.org:
 lame, faac, faad2, speex, xvidcore, schroedinger, openjpeg and x264.

If you additionally want support for amrnb and/or amrwb pass AMRNB=yes and/or
AMRWB=yes to the script. This will create non-redistributable binaries though.
amrnb and amrwb can also be found on SlackBuilds.org.

Support for the (slower) dirac codec libdirac can be enabled by passing DIRAC=yes
to the script. The (faster) dirac codec libschroedinger is already enabled by
default.

Those who have an nvidia graphics card which is capable of hardware video decoding
can enable VDPAU by passing VDPAU=yes to the script.
