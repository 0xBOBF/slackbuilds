wmii:
wmii: wmii is a dynamic window manager for X11. It supports classic and
wmii: dynamic window management with extended keyboard, mouse, and
wmii: filesystem based remote control. It replaces the workspace paradigm
wmii: with a new tagging approach. Its minimalist philosophy attempts to
wmii: not exceed 10.000 lines of code (including all shipped utilities and
wmii: libraries), to enforce simplicity and clarity.
