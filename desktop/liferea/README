Liferea is an aggregator for online news feeds. There are many
other news readers available, but these others are not available
for Linux or require many extra libraries to be installed. 
Liferea tries to fill this gap by creating a fast, easy to use,
easy to install news aggregator for GTK/GNOME.

Though it is intended for the GNOME desktop it integrates fine with
other environments. It supports a number of different feed formats
including RSS/RDF, CDF and Atom, allows direct subscriptions from 
Firefox 1.5.x (with FeedBag), Firefox 2.0.x and Epiphany.

Liferea depends on libxml2, ORBit2, GConf2, libxslt and either
libgtkembedmoz, libxul or gtkhtml2  libraries (all of those should be 
either part of the distribution or available from slackbuilds.org)
