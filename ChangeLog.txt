We're running a bit later than usual on getting ready for the new release 
  this time, but we think you'll agree that it was worth the wait for us
  to get all (or at least) most of the kinks worked out.  One of the most
  user-visible changes is the new REQUIRES variable in the .info files.
  For a description, see this git commit in our templates repo:
    http://slackbuilds.org/cgit/templates/commit/?h=14.0&id=fb892cce15779cbbfb
  Also note that the various template files can be viewed and/or downloaded
  via http here: http://slackbuilds.org/templates/
I'd like to take this time to welcome our newest admin, Matteo Bernardini
  (ponce) to the team and thank him for the huge amount of testing and
  updating of various scripts that he did.  On that note, I should thank
  David Somero (XGizzmo) for once again doing the automated build testing
  (and providing error logs) for this release, and of course all of his
  fixes and updates along the way.  Then there's Heinz Wiesinger (pprkut) for
  the usual fixes and updates, but he's also done a lot of work behind the
  scenes with database updates and our custom admin tools.  I'd be remiss if
  I didn't point out the never-ending job of server maintenance and upkeep 
  done by the SBo co-founder, Erik Hanson (erik), and that's on top of the
  usual fixes and updates all over the SBo tree.  Michiel van Wessem (BP{k})
  and Niels Horn (niels_horn) get the same kudos for helping out with all
  of the testing and fixing in the tree, and as much as I hate to talk nicely
  about rob0 (/dev/rob0), he actually deserves some kind words for his work
  on keeping our mail and dns working properly.
All of our users and maintainers deserve proper thanks for our existence, but
  Binh Nguyen and Willy Sudiarto Raharjo really stepped up and helped out with 
  lots of testing and fixing and updating needed to get the 14.0 repo ready.
  I'm sure I've left someone out, but please understand that my bad memory is
  in no way a reflection on your contributions.  Thanks to everyone for your
  contributions, regardless of how small or large they may have been. 
See the git log <http://slackbuilds.org/cgit/slackbuilds/log/?h=14.0> for
  detail changes since 13.37.  Now go forth and Slack!  
  --rworkman (on behalf of the entire SBo team)
