Remmina is a remote desktop client written in GTK+, aiming to be 
useful for system administrators and travelers, who need to work
with lots of remote computers in front of either large monitors or 
tiny netbooks. Remmina supports multiple network protocols in an 
integrated and consistent user interface. Currently RDP, VNC, NX,
XDMCP and SSH are supported.

This package contains a collection of plugins for Remmina.

This requires remmina and libssh.
