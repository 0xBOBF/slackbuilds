Boost Bindings is a bindings library for Boost.Ublas and others. 
It offers an easy way of calling BLAS, LAPACK, UMFPACK, MUMPS and 
many other mature legacy numerical codes from within C++.

The Boost Bindings Library is not an official part of Boost (hence the
separate package).  It requires Boost available from SlackBuilds.org.
