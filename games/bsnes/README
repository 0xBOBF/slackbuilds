bsnes is an emulator that began development on 2004-10-14. The
purpose of this emulator is a bit different from others: it
focuses on accuracy, debugging functionality, and clean code.

The emulator does not focus on things that would hinder accuracy.
This includes speed and game-specific hacks for compatibility. As
a result, the minimum system requirements for bsnes are very high.

bsnes requires OpenAL.
