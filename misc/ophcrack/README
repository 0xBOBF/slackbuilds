Ophcrack is a free Windows password cracker based on rainbow tables.
It is a very efficient implementation of rainbow tables done by the
inventors of the method. It comes with a Graphical User Interface
and runs on multiple platforms.

This optionally requires qt4 for the gui, but if you do not wish to
build the gui, you can use the command line mode; run the build script
like this:  GUI=no ./ophcrack.SlackBuild

Ophcrack has a graphing function that goes with the ophcrack gui. The
graphing function depends on the qwt package available at
slackbuilds.org.  qwt must be built with Qt4 as well by passing
QMAKE="qmake-qt4" to qwt.SlackBuild, otherwise, the ophcrack slackbuild will
fail with qwt Qt3 bindings.  To enable the graphing function run the
build script like this: GRAPH=yes ./ophcrack.SlackBiuld
