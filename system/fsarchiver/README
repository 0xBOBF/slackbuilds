FSArchiver is a system tool that allows you to save the contents of 
a file-system to a compressed archive file. The file-system can be 
restored on a partition which has a different size and it can be 
restored on a different file-system.  Unlike tar/dar, FSArchiver 
also creates the file-system when it extracts the data to partitions. 

Everything is checksummed in the archive in order to protect the data. 
If the archive is corrupt, you just loose the current file, not the 
whole archive.

Build Notes:
Please note that LZMA support is disabled in the script, the source 
apparently needs next major version of LZMA (renamed XZ) which is 
still in beta.

Static binary is built so it can be copied with your backup scripts and 
used when you don't have package installed but need the binary.

Dependencies:
zlib, bzip2, e2fsprogs and other filesystem tools which are all part 
of Slackware.

There are no man pages in the package.  For short help, fsarchiver -h.
