K-3D is free-as-in-freedom 3D modeling and animation software. It features a
plugin-oriented procedural engine for all of its content, making K-3D a very
versatile and powerful package.

K-3D excels at polygonal modeling, and includes basic tools for NURBS,
patches, curves and animation.

This requires gtkglext, libsigc++, glibmm, cairomm, pangomm and gtkmm
(building / installing in this order should work fine)

Optional packages: graphviz, gtksourceview, libgnome and OpenCASCADE.
