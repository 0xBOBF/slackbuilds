gparted: Gnome Partition Editor
gparted: 
gparted: GParted uses GNU libparted to detect and manipulate devices and
gparted: partition tables. Several (optional) "file system" tools provide
gparted: support for file systems not included in libparted. These optional
gparted: packages will be detected at runtime and do not require a rebuild
gparted: of GParted. GParted is written in C++ and uses gtkmm for it's
gparted: Graphical User Interface (GUI).
