qt-creator (Cross-Platform Qt IDE)

Qt Creator is a new cross-platform integrated development environment
(IDE) tailored to the needs of Qt developers.

Note:
qdoc3 must be installed to build docs (This should be considered a bug).
If you intend to install docs you have to build qt4 from source applying 
a patch to enable building qdoc3.  There is an online version of the 
docs here: http://doc.trolltech.com/qtcreator-1.1/
