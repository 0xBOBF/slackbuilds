Wine is an Open Source implementation of the Windows API on top of X and Unix.

This script includes the capability to enable/disable OpenGL acceleration: 
read the script for more information.

If you are building this on Slamd64, execute the build script as follows:
  DISTRO=slamd64 ARCH=x86_64 ./wine.SlackBuild

If you build on a multicore system, add JOBS={#} to enable parallel
compilation, as in:   JOBS=4 ./wine.SlackBuild
which starts up to 4 build jobs simultaneously.

While it's not strictly required, the fontforge package is strongly 
recommended to be installed when building wine.
