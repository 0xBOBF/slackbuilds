QStarDict is a StarDict clone written using Qt4.
The user interface is similar to StarDict.
It features full support of StarDict dictionaries, system tray
functionality, and many others.

This requires qt4; the build script should work with both qt4 packages 
from SlackBuilds.org or testing/ in official releases.
