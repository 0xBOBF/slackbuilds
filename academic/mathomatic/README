Mathomatic is designed to be as general and easy to use as possible.
The software implements most of the rules of algebra for addition,
subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo division, and all forms
of exponentiation. All arithmetic is double precision floating point
with up to 14 decimal digits accuracy.

Mathomatic can symbolically:
*combine and solve equations containing many variables
*completely simplify and compare expressions and equations
*do simple calculus transformations and series
*perform standard, complex number, and polynomial arithmetic
*generate optimized C, Java, and Python language code from simplified equations
*carry out quick calculations, etc.

Not implemented in Mathomatic are a GUI with plotting, named mathematical
functions (such as f(x) and log(x)), arbitrary-precision arithmetic, and
matricies.
