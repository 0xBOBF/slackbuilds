Mosh is a remote terminal application that allows roaming, supports 
intermittent connectivity, and provides intelligent local echo and line 
editing of user keystrokes.

Mosh attempts to improve on SSH by being more robust and responsive, 
especially over Wi-Fi, cellular, and long-distance links.

Mosh requires a little tweaking after first install on Slackware. Both 
the Mosh server and client applications must be run with a a UTF-8 
locale, which is not Slackware's default.

To configure your client to work in a UTF-8 locale you should refer to 
Slackware documentation.

For the server (remotehost), Mosh gets its locale setting from the 
client that is conecting to it. Slackware's SSH client and server do not 
send and receive locale information in their default configuration (SSH 
is used bootstrap the Mosh connection). Assuming that you have 
configured the client to use a UTF-8 locale you can work around this by 
connecting to the remotehost as follows:

$ mosh remotehost --server="LANG=$LANG mosh-server"

To avoid having to do this every time add 'SendEnv LANG LC_COLLATE' to 
/etc/ssh/ssh_config (on the client) and 'AcceptEnv LANG LC_COLLATE' to 
/etc/ssh/sshd_config (on the remotehost) and then restart the server's 
SSH daemon.

Mosh depends on protobuf and perl-IO-Tty.
