LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing
based on the structure of your documents, not their appearance. It is
released under a Free Software / Open Source license.

LyX is for people that write and want their writing to look great, right out
of the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting details, 'finger
painting' font attributes or futzing around with page boundaries. You just
write. In the background, Prof. Knuth's legendary TeX typesetting engine
makes you look good.
