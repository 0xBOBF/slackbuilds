BOUML is a free UML 2 tool box (under development) allowing you to specify
and generate code in C++, Java, Idl, Php and Python.

BOUML runs under Unix/Linux/Solaris, MacOS X(Power PC and Intel) and
Windows.

BOUML is very fast and doesn't require much memory to manage several
thousands of classes, see benchmark.

BOUML is extensible, and the external tools named plug-outs can be written
in C++ or Java, using BOUML for their definition as any other program. The
code generators and reverses are ones of the pre-defined plug-outs included
in the BOUML distribution.

Qt 2.3 and higher or any Qt 3 and qmake are required. On some distributions
like Debian and Ubuntu you also need qt3-compat-headers if you use a
Qt3. Qt 4 can't be used because it is non compatible with the previous
releases.

Depending on the options used to produce the Qt library you may have a
problem during the link concerning the Motif, Motif plus and Windows
styles. In this case compile BOUML defining the needed pre-processor
variables QT_NO_STYLE_MOTIF, QT_NO_STYLE_MOTIFPLUS and QT_NO_STYLE_WINDOWS.
