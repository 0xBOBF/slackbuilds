# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

quassel: quassel is a cross-platform IRC client built on qt4.  quassel core 
quassel: connects to servers and quassel client connects to quassel core over
quassel: the internet.  It means you can retain your IRC sessions even if you 
quassel: exit your X session.  Multiple clients can attach to and detach from 
quassel: a central core.  It's like a combination of GNU screen with such 
quassel: console IRC clients as weechat and irssi.
