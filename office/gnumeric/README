The goal of Gnumeric is to be the best possible spreadsheet. We are not
attempting to clone existing applications. However, Gnumeric can read
files saved with other spreadsheets and we offer a customizable feel 
that attempts to minimize the costs of transition.

In order to compile, goffice is required.
There are also optional dependencies, the list of which can be found
here:  http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnumeric/downloads.shtml
