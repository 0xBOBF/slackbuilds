ePSXe (enhanced PSX emulator) is an emulator of the Sony PlayStation video 
game console for x86-based PC hardware. It was written by three authors, 
using the aliases "Calb", "_Demo_", and "Galtor". It has been described as 
the best freeware Playstation emulator available.

ePSXe makes use of a plugin system to emulate GPU, SPU, and CD drive functions
	* GPU: Most GPU plugins run with either Direct3D, OpenGL, or the 
	Glide API, and are available freeware or open source.
	* SPU: The SPU plugins can emulate everything from music to sound 
	effects, with varying degrees of success depending on the plugin 
	settings, and of course the plugin being used.
	* CD-ROM: ePSXe comes with a core CD-ROM plugin, but many others 
	are available for freeware download and many can emulate up to 
	seven different types of read modes.
	* Input: The core plugin is sufficient, but there are others that 
	allow for more functionality. It is even possible to plug in and 
	use a DualShock controller with a USB adapter.

If you want to add plugins to the epsxe, go to $HOME/.epsxe, where you 
will find the plugins directory.  Note that this script installs many
needed directories owned by root:games and writable by that group; if you
want a user to be able to install plugins, then make sure they are in the
games group.
