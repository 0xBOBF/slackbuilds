Gwenview is a fast and easy to use image viewer for KDE.
It features a folder tree window as well as a file list window
to provide easy navigation among your images. Gwenview can either 
be used as standalone application or embedded in Konqueror via KParts.

Internationalization files are available in the gwenview-i18n package.

Gwenview depends on exiv2 (mandatory) and libkipi (optional), both of 
which are available from SlackBuilds.org.
