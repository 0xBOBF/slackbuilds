The linux prctl function allows you to control specific characteristics of
a process' behaviour.  This module provides a nice non-messy python(ic)
interface to prctl(2).

Besides prctl, this library also wraps libcap for complete capabilities(7)
handling and allows you to set the process name as seen in ps and top.
