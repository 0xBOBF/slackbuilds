QEMU is a generic and open source processor emulator which achieves a good emulation speed by using dynamic translation. 


QEMU has two operating modes: 

Full system emulation. In this mode, QEMU emulates a full system (for example a PC), including a processor and various peripherials. It can be used to launch different Operating Systems without rebooting the PC or to debug system code. 

User mode emulation (Linux host only). In this mode, QEMU can launch Linux processes compiled for one CPU on another CPU. 


An optional proprietary QEMU Accelerator Module (kqemu) is available to optimize the case where a PC is emulated on a PC. This module enables QEMU to run most of the target application code directly on the host processor to achieve near native performance.

This build of QEMU is built with support for kqemu.  To achieve this, the QEMU build process probes for current kernel path.  A different kernel path can be set by editing qemu.SlackBuild.  QEMU and kqemu should be built and used against the same kernel version.
If you are not planning on using kqemu, you may edit the SlackBuild and remove the --enable-kqemu line if you wish.
