ZNC is an advanced IRC bouncer

ZNC will remain connected to an IPv4 or IPv6 IRC server even while you
are offline. You can reattach your client at a later time and catch up
with what happened while you were gone via the history buffer. You can
add additional users under one running process: useful for public shells
that limit background processes. ZNC also supports the dynamic loading
of C++ and Perl modules.

Once the package is installed, you can interactivly create your znc.conf 
using the following command:
	/usr/bin/znc --makeconf --datadir /etc/znc
Once you have answered all the questions, your znc.conf file will be located
at /etc/znc/configs/znc.conf.

It is recommended that you do *NOT* run znc as 'root' but rather as a 
more benign user such as 'nobody'. It should be noted that you can
only run as a non-root user if you choose a listening port higher than
1024. The following is necessary to allow znc to be run as the 'nobody'
user; it only needs to be run once:
	chown -R nobody:nobody /etc/znc
To actually execute ZNC as the 'nobody' user, use the following command:
	su - nobody -c '/usr/bin/znc --datadir /etc/znc'
By default, ZNC will look for its configuration file in ~/.znc.  If you 
used the '--datadir' option when creating the znc.conf file, it must also 
be used when starting ZNC.
