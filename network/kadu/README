Kadu is a dynamically evolving instant messenger compatible with the 
Gadu-Gadu protocol. 

Kadu's modular structure enables the programmer to add new functionality
by writing a new module or to remove unneeded features by not building
all shipped modules.

Some features include Gadu-Gadu v6.1 support, contacts' groups with drag and
drop support, message encryption with OpenSSL, detailed error notification, 
and configurable windows look (colors).

BUILDING NOTES:
If you leave the default configuration, Kadu depends on libsndfile 
(which is available on SlackBuilds.org).

If you wish to customize Kadu build, then copy the .config file from sources 
to SlackBuild directory, rename it config and edit it to fulfill your needs.

You need to be on-line in order to download additional modules that are not
included in the sources.
