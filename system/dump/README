DUMP (dump and restore backup commands)

Dump examines files in a filesystem, determines which ones need to be 
backed up, and copies those files to a specified disk, tape or other 
storage medium. Subsequent incremental backups can then be layered on top
of the full backup.

SLACKWARE ISSUES WITH DUMP/RESTORE/RMT

Dump package conflicts with these two files from the tar package:
	the rmt man page:	 	/usr/man/man8/rmt.8.gz
	and the restore application:	/usr/sbin/restore 
Installing the dump package will overwrite these files. 

Should you remove the dump package, you may note that the two files 
referred to above will not be removed because they are "shared" with 
the tar package.   You will need to reinstall the stock tar package.

With regards to rmt, the tar package installs it to /sbin/rmt while the
dump package installs it in /usr/sbin/rmt - these two are not identical.
You can be sure to call the relevant rmt application by qualifying the 
full path to the desired rmt executable.
