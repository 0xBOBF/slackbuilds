# rsbac-admin has sensible CFLAGS, according the documentation a CFLAGs
# parameter can be added to make. Unfortunately, this clears other
# important flags. We could patch a bunch of Makefiles to correctly accept
# CFLAGs, but the gain of "-mtune=i686" is doubtful for these tools,
# so modifying the vanilla sources is not really worth it IMO.
