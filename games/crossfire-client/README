Crossfire is an open source, cooperative multiplayer graphical RPG and 
adventure game. Since its initial release, Crossfire has grown to encompass 
over 150 monsters, about 3000 maps to explore, an elaborate magic system, 
13 races, 15 character classes, a system of skills, and many artifacts and 
treasures. Crossfire is based in a medieval fantasy world and is similar to 
other games of this genre.

NOTE: If you have GTK+2 installed, the GTK+2 (gcfclient2) client will be 
built.  This client is still "experimental".  While it should be fine to use, 
it isn't as well tested and isn't as stable as the GTK+1 (gcfclient) or CF 
(cfclient) clients.  With respect to this, the Crossfire menu entry will 
launch gcfclient instead of gcfclient2.  This can be changed with a simple 
modification to the /usr/share/applications/crossfire-client.desktop file
after installing the package - change the "Exec" line.
