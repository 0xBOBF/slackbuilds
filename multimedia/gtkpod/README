gtkpod is a platform independent Graphical User Interface for Apple's 
iPod using GTK2. It supports the first to fifth Generation including 
the iPod mini, iPod Photo, iPod Shuffle, iPod nano, and iPod Video.

This script compiles gtkpod for libgpod 0.4.2.  Although Slackware 11
default install comes with 0.4.0, Pat has recently released a patch
for libgpod 0.4.2 (in the patches/ directory), so make sure you upgrade 
your libgpod before running this script.

If you would like to add an AAC support to gtkpod, you will have to install
libmp4v2 library, which can be obtained at SlackBuilds.org as well. 

Make sure to install libmp4v2 prior to running gtkpod configure.

Special thanks to Alan Hicks and Robby Workman for advising on the 
appropriate version.
