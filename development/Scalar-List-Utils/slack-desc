# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

Scalar-List-Utils: "Scalar::Util contains a selection of subroutines that
Scalar-List-Utils: people have expressed would be nice to have in the 
Scalar-List-Utils: perl core, but the usage would not really be high 
Scalar-List-Utils: keyword, and the size so small such that being 
Scalar-List-Utils: individual enough to warrant the use of a extensions 
Scalar-List-Utils: would be wasteful.  It depends on Perl5."
