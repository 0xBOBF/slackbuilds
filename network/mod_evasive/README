mod_evasive maneuvers module for Apache to provide evasive action in the event
of an HTTP DoS or DDoS attack or brute force attack. It is also designed
to be a detection and network management tool, and can be easily configured
to talk to ipchains, firewalls, routers, and etcetera. mod_evasive presently
reports abuses via email and syslog facilities.

Detection is performed by creating an internal dynamic hash table of IP
Addresses and URIs, and denying any single IP address from any of the
following:


    * Requesting the same page more than a few times per second
    * Making more than 50 concurrent requests on the same child per second
    * Making any requests while temporarily blacklisted (on a blocking list)


To enable it edit /etc/httpd/httpd.conf to have like the following:

LoadModule evasive20_module lib/httpd/modules/mod_evasive20.so

<IfModule mod_evasive20.c>
    DOSHashTableSize    3097
    DOSPageCount        2
    DOSSiteCount        50
    DOSPageInterval     1
    DOSSiteInterval     1
    DOSBlockingPeriod   10
</IfModule>


To test enter the following command:

	perl /usr/doc/mod_evasive-$VERSION/test.pl | more

Which should output some HTTP/1.1 200 OK lines; then HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden

mod_evasive is fully tweakable through the Apache configuration file, see
the READE file in /usr/doc/mod_evasive-$VERSION for configuration details.
