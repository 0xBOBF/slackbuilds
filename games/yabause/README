Requires: gtkglext

Optional: mini18n, OpenAL and Qt4.

By default the gtk interface is built.  If you would like to build
the Qt4 interface then pass HAVE_QT4=yes to the slackbuild.  This
additionally makes Qt4 a requirement.

For translation support install mini18n.

Before using Yabause, you need to configure a few things in
the Preferences dialog (File>Settings).
