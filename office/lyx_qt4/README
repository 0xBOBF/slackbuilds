LyX - A WYSIWYM document processor.

LyX is for people that write and want their writing to look great,
right out of the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting
details, 'finger painting' font attributes or futzing around with
page boundaries. You just write. In the background, Prof. Knuth's
legendary TeX typesetting engine makes you look good.

This version of lyx (1.5.x) requires  qt4 (qt-4.x), for which a build
script is also available at SlackBuilds.org.  Note that this package
conflicts with the lyx-1.4.x package that links qt3, so pick one or 
the other.
