VTE is a terminal emulator widget for use with GTK+.  This package
contains the VTE library and development files and a sample
implementation (vte).

The VTE library inserts terminal capability strings into a tree 
of tables, and then uses it to determine if data received from a 
pseudo-terminal is a control sequence or just random data.
