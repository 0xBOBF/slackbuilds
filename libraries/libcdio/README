libcdio (GNU Compact Disc Input and Control Library)

The libcdio package contains a library for CD-ROM and CD image
access. Applications wishing to be oblivious of the OS- and
device-dependent properties of a CD-ROM or of the specific details of
various CD-image formats may benefit from using this library.

From the README.libcdio in the source tree:

VCD dependency:
---------------
One thing that confuses people is the "dependency" on libvcdinfo from
vcdimager, while vcdimager has a dependency on libcdio.  This libcdio
dependency on vcdimager is an optional (i.e. not mandatory) dependency,
while the vcdimager dependency right now is mandatory. libvcdinfo is
used only by the utility program cd-info. If you want cd-info to use
the VCD reporting portion and you don't already have vcdimager
installed, build and install libcdio, then vcdimager, then configure
libcdio again and it should find libvcdinfo.

People who make packages might consider making two packages, a libcdio
package with just the libraries (and no dependency on libvcdinfo) and
a libcdio-utils which contains cd-info and iso-info, cd-read,
iso-read. Should you want cd-info with VCD support then you'd add a
dependency in that package to libvcdinfo.

Another thing one can do is "make install" inside the library, or run
"configure --without-vcd-info --without-cddb" (since libcddb also has
an optional dependency on libcdio).
