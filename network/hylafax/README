HylaFAX is an enterprise-class system for sending and receiving
facsimiles as well as for sending alpha-numeric pages.The software
is designed around a client-server architecture. Fax modems may
reside on a single machine on a network and clients can submit
an outbound job from any other machine on the network.

Client software is designed to be lightweight and easy to port. 


If you need to start hylafax at boot
edit /etc/rc.d/rc.local and add the lines:

script:
# Starting the HylaFAX hfaxd and faxq Daemons at Boot.
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.hylafax ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.hylafax start
  fi

Edit /etc/inittab and add a line(s) similar to:

m0:2345:respawn:/usr/libexec/hylafax/faxgetty ttyS0

where 'm0' is unique in inittab and 'ttyS0' matches the device
name(s) used at the outset of the faxaddmodem script. 

With root permissions, execute '/usr/sbin/faxsetup'.
When finished, faxsetup will automatically run faxaddmodem
for you. Generally, you can follow all of the defaults
except those for FaxMaster, the local fax number(s), TSI,
and any modem-specific information in faxaddmodem.

It would be wise to run faxcron and faxqclean regularly
from cron so that the queue directories do not clutter
up and fill the storage device. Many installations run
faxqclean every hour and faxcron every day. Insert
something like this into your uucp or root crontab file:

0 * * * * /usr/sbin/faxqclean
0 0 * * * /usr/sbin/faxcron | mail -s "HylaFAX Usage Report" faxmaster
