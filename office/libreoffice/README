LibreOffice is a productivity suite that is compatible with other major office
suites, and available on a variety of platforms. It is free software and
therefore free to download, use and distribute.

This script builds a Slackware package from the official binary (RPM's) 
distributed by The Document Foundation.  Everything needed by the application
should be built statically into it, so there aren't any dependencies not
satisfied by a normal installation.

Be sure to look at the script for some optional things you can do when building.

NOTE:
This is for the BETA version, that does *not* include the language packs yet!
So no spell-checker etc. for now.
