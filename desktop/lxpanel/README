LXpanel (NETWM/EWMH compliant lightweight x11 desktop panel)

Based on fbpanel, lxpanel provides an application menu generated from
.desktop files as well as a launchbar, taskbar, and various plugins.
 
The system-wide default configuration file is located under 
/usr/share/lxpanel/default. Users can easily change their configuration
via the preferences dialog.  

Lxpanelctl is used to control the behavior of lxpanel during runtime.
See the README file included with the source code for details.
