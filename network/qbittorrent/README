qBittorrent : a C++ / Qt4 Bittorrent Client
 
The qBittorrent project was created in March 2006 with the idea
of developing a new Bittorrent client for Linux (and possibly
other systems) that would be easy to use, good looking, featureful
but lightweight.

qBittorrent requires qt4 and libtorrent-rasterbar.
