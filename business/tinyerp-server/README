Tiny ERP is a complete ERP and CRM. The main features are accounting
(analytic and financial), stock management, sales and purchases management,
tasks automation, marketing campaigns, help desk, POS, etc. Technical
features include a distributed server, flexible workflows, an object
database, a dynamic GUI, customizable reports, and SOAP and XML-RPC
interfaces.

Before you can use tinyerp-server, you will have to set up postgresql. All
you have to do is issue the following two commands:

  createuser -U postgres --no-adduser terp
  createdb -U postgres -O terp  --encoding=UNICODE terp

This will setup Tiny ERP for the use with postgresql on localhost.  There is
no need to set a password on localhost. However, if you are going to run
postgresql on a different server, you will have to run createuser like this:

  createuser -U postgres --no-adduser -P terp

Tiny ERP depends on pyparsing, egenix-mx-base, psycopg, pil, pyxml, reportlab,
and postgresql, all of which are available from SlackBuilds.org
