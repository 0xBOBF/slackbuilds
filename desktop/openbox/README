Openbox is a standards compliant, fast, light-weight, extensible
window manager.  Openbox was written first to comply with standards
and to work properly.  Openbox is fully functional as a stand-alone
working environment, or can be used as a drop-in replacement for
the default window manager in the GNOME or KDE desktop environments.
