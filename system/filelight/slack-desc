filelight: Filelight is an alternative file manager for KDE.  Filelight creates
filelight: an interactive map of concentric segmented-rings that helps you to 
filelight: visualize disk usage on your computer.
filelight: It is like a pie-chart, but the segments are nested, which allows 
filelight: you to see not only which directories take up all your space, but 
filelight: which files and subdirectories are the real culprits.
