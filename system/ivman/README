Ivman is a generic handler for HAL events.

Originally for automounting, it can now be used to run arbitrary
commands when events or conditions occur or properties are modified on
your hardware (e.g., run a command when you close your laptop's lid,
run a command when a particular device is attached or a particular CD
is inserted, etc).

This package requires HAL, which is also available at SlackBuilds.org.

If combined with 'pmount' instances can also be launched per user session
(e.g., create a link to /usr/bin/ivman in ~/.kde/Autostart). When a device
is attached, Ivman will call pmount to mount the device. Otherwise
/etc/fstab are need to be there for the devices.
