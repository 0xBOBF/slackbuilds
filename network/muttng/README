mutt next generation (mutt-ng) is a fork of the well-known email client mutt
with the goal to both incorporate all the patches that are floating around
in the web, and to fix all the other little annoyances of mutt.

This is a build from the daily snapshots of the source code. The md5sum
cannot be used to check the validity of the downloaded file as it will
change everytime the snapshot is re-generated.  This script was last tested
with a snapshot from 20061014.
