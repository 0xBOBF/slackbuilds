LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to
writing based on the structure of your documents, not their
appearance. It is released under a Free Software / Open Source
license.

LyX is for people that write and want their writing to look great,
right out of the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting
details, 'finger painting' font attributes or futzing around with
page boundaries. You just write. In the background, Prof. Knuth's
legendary TeX typesetting engine makes you look good.

On screen, LyX looks like any word processor; its printed output
-- or richly cross-referenced PDF, just as readily produced --
looks like nothing else. Gone are the days of industrially bland
.docs, all looking similarly not-quite-right, yet coming out
unpredictably different on different printer drivers. Gone are the
crashes 'eating' your dissertation the evening before going to press.

Please note that Lyx 1.5.x will not be available until Slackware ships with
QT4, or until more Lyx frontends are released (at the moment, the only
frontend is for QT 4).

Thank you
