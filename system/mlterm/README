mlterm is a multilingual X11 terminal emulator. It supports 
different character sets, encondings and complex characters.

mlterm is optionally dependent upon the following libraries:

- fribidi (for bidirectional rendering) 
http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/FriBidi

- libind (for ISCII rendering) 
http://www.rxvt-idev.freeservers.com/

If fribidi and libind have been installed on your system
you can enable the support by adding the following 
compilation options to mlterm.slackbuild:

  --enable-fribidi
  --enable-ind
