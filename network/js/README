js (SpiderMonkey JavaScript-C Engine)

The SpiderMonkey engine is Mozilla's C implementation of JavaScript.  It is
intended to be embedded into other programs. In particular, it's used by ELinks
for JavaScript support. 

This version includes a patch (from the ELinks) project to compile it easier.

After installation, run: ldconfig -v | grep libjs.so
and you should see: libjs.so -> libjs.so
