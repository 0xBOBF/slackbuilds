Fully integrated ERP, CRM, and accounting for small to midsized
businesses. Business logic resides in PostgreSQL database server.
Fully international-ready.

For xtuple to work correctly you need to setup postgresql.
Issuing the following commands should be enough:
  psql -U postgres -f /usr/share/xtuple/init.sql
  createdb -U mfgadmin NEW_DATABASE_NAME
  pg_restore -U mfgadmin -d NEW_DATABASE_NAME postbooks_quickstart.backup -v

The "postbooks_quickstart.backup" file is one of three schemas available
on http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/postbooks/. The others
are "postbooks_demo.backup" and "postbooks_empty.backup". You will have to
choose one of these depending on your needs.

Requires qt4, openrpt and postgresql (runtime dependency). All of which
are available from SlackBuilds.org.
