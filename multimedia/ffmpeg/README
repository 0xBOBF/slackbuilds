FFmpeg is a complete solution to record, convert and stream audio
and video. It includes libavcodec, the leading audio/video codec
library.

This script is tested using the svn code from 20071003, and this is
the tarball hosted on our site.  You may elect to use this source
code to build the package, or you can pull the latest from their
subversion repository as indicated below.

If you want to use the latest subversion source when building your
ffmpeg package, you will need to get it from their svn server. 
To get the source code, you can use the included "ffmpeg-srctarball.sh" 
script, which will to download the source code and create a compressed 
tarball of it using the date (date +"%Y%m%d") as its version string.

If you have already ffmpeg's source code as a tarball, for example:
  ffmpeg-20071003.tar.bz2 
You can tell the build script to use it with the following command:
  VERSION=20071003 ./ffmpeg.SlackBuild
Note that this is the version that will be used by default unless you
specify otherwise.

ffmpeg requires the following, all of which are available at SlackBuilds.org:
 lame, faac, faad2, xvidcore, a52dec, and x264
