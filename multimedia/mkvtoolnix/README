MKVToolnix is a set of tools to create, alter and inspect Matroska
(and WebM) files. With these tools one can:

* Get information about Matroska files (mkvinfo) * Extract tracks/data
from Matroska files (mkvextract) * Create Matroska files from other
media files (mkvmerge) * Modify properties of existing Matroska files
(mkvpropedit)

This requires wxGTK or wxPython.

It comes with internal versions of libembl and libmatroska, which will
be used if system-wide installations of them are not present.

Interested parties can build a QT GUI by passing QTGUI=yes
