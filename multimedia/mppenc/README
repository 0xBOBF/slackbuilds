The encoder mppenc is a command line tool that produces MPC or 
Musepack files. Musepack is an audio compression format with a strong 
emphasis on high quality. It is based on the MPEG-1 Layer-2 / MP2 
algorithms, but since 1997 it has rapidly developed and vastly 
improved and is now at an advanced stage in which it contains heavily 
optimized and patentless code.
