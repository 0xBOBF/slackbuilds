The Structured Terminal Forms Language/Library

STFL is a library which implements a curses-based widget set for text
terminals. The STFL API can be used from C, SPL, Python, Perl and
Ruby.  The public STFL API is only 14 simple function calls big and
and there are already generic SWIG bindings; thus it is very easy to 
port to additional scripting languages.
