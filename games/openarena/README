OpenArena is an open-source content package for Quake III Arena licensed 
under the GPL, effectively creating a free stand-alone game. 
You do not need Quake III Arena to play this game.

OpenArena has bots, network playability, many maps and most of the other 
features you would expect from a commercial first person shooter.

OpenArena requires the OpenAL library found on SlackBuilds.org.  It also 
requires 3D accelerated video drivers but runs quite well on the open-source 
Intel drivers.

Please be advised that the main game zip file, oa070.zip, is about 250MB.  
Additionally, one must download the following patch:
	http://oxygen4.free.fr/dl/oa071-patch.zip
	md5sum 5fa31998009f8241ad3ded93eb81e701
which is about 12MB, and place it in the directory with the SlackBuild and 
the main game zip file.  The SlackBuild will patch the original source and 
install version 0.7.1 of OpenArena.  

Note: this SlackBuild sets things up for i386, but 64 bit binaries are also 
copied into the game directory, so with minor edits to the doinst.sh and the 
two *.desktop files this script could be used with 64 bit systems, but this 
is untested.
