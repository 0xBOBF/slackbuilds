FCSalyzer: a free program for analysing flow cytometry data.
 
FCSalyzer is a simple application for analysing flow cytometry data. It is
based on the "What you see is what you get" principle with the hope of
being intuitive to use. For more information, please visit the project web-
page.

Supported datafiles (depending on the type of flow cytometer and
acquisition software) are listed in "datafiles.txt", found in the
documentation folder of the created package.
