uWSGI is a fast (pure C), self-healing, developer-friendly WSGI server, aimed
for professional Python webapp deployment and development.  Over time it has
evolved in a complete stack for networked/clustered Python applications,
implementing message/object passing, RPC and process management.  It uses the
uwsgi (all lowercase) protocol for all the networking/interprocess
communications.

uWSGI can be integrated with various webservers (apache2, nginx, cherokee and
lighttpd modules available).

Note: this script only builds the uWSGI server.
