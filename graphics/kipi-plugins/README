Kipi Plugins are additional functions for the KDE Images Managment
Host Programs (digiKam, KimDaBa, ShowImg, and Gwenview). They can add
extra menus and shortcuts, and extend the host programs features. You
can install as many or as few as you like, from within host programs.

exiv2, libkdcraw, libkexiv2, and libkipi (available at SBo) are
required to build Kipi Plugins.
