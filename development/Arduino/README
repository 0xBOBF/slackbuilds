The open-source Arduino Software (IDE) makes it easy to write code and upload
it to the board. It runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. The environment
is written in Java and based on Processing and other open-source software.
This software can be used with any Arduino board.

NOTE: This script no longer uses binary packages from the upstream, and
it's a complete rewrite from scratch. Currently, the upstream compiles on a
system which uses libraries not found in stock Slackware packages, namely
libtinfo from ncurses. This change affects both compile taking longer and
a free space requirement now being close to 1GB.
