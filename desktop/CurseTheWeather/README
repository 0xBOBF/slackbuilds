CurseTheWeather v0.3

CurseTheWeather is a curses application which displays the
weather in a terminal. It can give the current weather as
well as forcast for up to 10 days.

weatherfeed.py is a module that it uses and it can be used
by other frontends to get weather information. Each time it
is instantiated, it grabs the weather from weather.com

Due to the fact that the CurseTheWeather website uses trac the 
download is somewhat misformed when using wget. If you use FF or another 
browser this problem should not occur.

The following commandshould solve this:
mv CurseTheWeather-0.3.tar.gz\?format\=raw CurseTheWeather-0.3.tar.gz
