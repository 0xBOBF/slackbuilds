The purpose of pygccxml is to read a generated file and provide a
simple framework to navigate C++ declarations, using Python classes.
It provides functionality to extract and inspect declarations from
C/C++ header files. This is accomplished by invoking the external tool
gccxml which parses a header file and dumps the declarations as a XML
file. This XML file is then read by pygccxml and the contents are made
available as appropriate Python objects.

The pygccxml package is dependent upon gccxml package, also available
on SlackBuilds.org.
