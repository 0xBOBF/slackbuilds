ssh-keyinstall helps an ssh user set up the keys at both ends of an ssh
connection.

ssh-keyinstall is a script that helps an ssh user set up the
keys at both ends of an ssh connection.  It creates an rsa or dsa key if
needed and copies the public half to the server.  Once the process is
done, you'll be able to log in with the passphrase and key instead of a
password.
