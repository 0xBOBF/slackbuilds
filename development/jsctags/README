jsctags is a ctags-compatible code indexing solution for JavaScript.
Its interface and output are essentially identical to Exuberant Ctags,
but, instead of simply parsing the JavaScript, jsctags uses a simple
form of abstract interpretation to determine which symbols are exported.
This allows jsctags to achieve much better results than Exuberant Ctags.
Popular libraries such as jQuery and CommonJS modules can now be
meaningfully indexed.

This requires node.
