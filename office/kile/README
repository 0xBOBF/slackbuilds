Kile is a user friendly TeX/LaTeX editor for the KDE desktop environment.

To Run Kile, you will be required to have the following components installed on
your system:
  K Desktop environment (KDE): KDE is a popular open-source desktop environment.
  Qt: Qt is a C++ development tool needed to compile Kile.
  LATEX: a high-quality document typesetting program.  Most likely you have (or 
  want) the teTEX package, since you are on a Unix-like system.

Optional packages:
  KDVI: DVI viewer for KDE.
  GnuPlot: scientific plotting package.
  XFig: drawing program for X window.
