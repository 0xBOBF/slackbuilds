Netbeans - Free and Open-Source IDE for Java Development and More.

The NetBeans IDE is a free, Open-Source Integrated Development
Environment for software developers. The IDE runs on many platforms
including Windows, Linux, Solaris, and the MacOS. The NetBeans IDE
provides developers with all the tools they need to create
professional cross-platform desktop, enterprise, web and mobile

NOTE:
You can make a localised package with this SlackBuild 
(default is english). For example:

To get netbeans in Spanish - Español (es) :
1. Go to: http://www.netbeans.info/downloads/all.php?b_id=3095
2. Under "Archive Distributions", download the package:
   netbeans-5_5_1-es.zip
3. Execute the slackbuild as:
   NBLANG=es ./netbeans.SlackBuild
   to get this package in /tmp: netbeans-5.5.1_es-i586-1_SBo.tgz

Other values for NBLANG could be: ja, pt_BR, zh_CN, de and zh_TW

This SlackBuild was tested with "es" and "pt_BR" and with default
language(english) so if it serves to you for the other values it's
a good idea to send feedback about it :)
