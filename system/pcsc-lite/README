PC/SC-lite (Personal Computer/Smart Card interface)

This is a middleware to access a smart card using SCard API (PC/SC) Its purpose
is to provide a Windows(R) SCard interface in a very small form factor for 
communicating to smart cards and readers.

It is compiled with --enable-usbdropdir=/usr/lib/pcsc/drivers
This will be the destination directory for usb readers' drivers (ccid, cardman,
others).

NOTE: drivers are not included and must be compiled and installed separately. 
See /usr/doc/pcsc-lite-1.4.102/DRIVERS for more information on getting and 
installing specific drivers.

For serial and pcmcia readers only, it is necessary to edit files in 
/etc/reader.conf.d/ and run "/usr/sbin/update-reader.conf".

Compiling with "DEBUGATR=1 ./pcsc-lite.SlackBuild" enables ATR parsing debug 
output messages.

Compiling with "APIDOC=1 ./pcsc-lite.SlackBuild" produces API .pdf
documentation (mainly intended for developers).

To start PC/SC-lite daemon, run "/etc/rc.d/rc.pcscd start".
For pcmcia readers, this daemon should be started after rc.pcmcia - this is 
most easily accomplished by adding the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.pcscd ]; then
		/etc/rc.d/rc.pcscd start
	fi
