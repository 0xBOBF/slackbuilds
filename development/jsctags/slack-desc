# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

jsctags: jsctags (ctags-compatible code indexer for JavaScript)
jsctags:
jsctags: jsctags interface and output are essentially identical to Exuberant
jsctags: Ctags, but, instead of simply parsing the JavaScript, jsctags uses a
jsctags: simple form of abstract interpretation to determine which symbols are
jsctags: exported.  This allows jsctags to achieve much better results than
jsctags: Exuberant Ctags.
