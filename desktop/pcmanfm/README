PCManFM is an extremely fast and lightweight GTK+ based file 
manager which features tabbed browsing and a user-friendly
interface.
 
Note:  PCManFM requires a 2.6 kernel and the gamin library available on
SlackBuilds.org.  Additionally, this SlackBuild disables HAL support.  
If one has manually installed HAL, this configuration option can be 
enabled.
