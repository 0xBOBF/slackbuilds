This is a re-bundle of the gmpc-plugins tarball available here:
http://download.sarine.nl/Programs/gmpc/0.17.0/gmpc-plugins-0.17.0.tar.gz

I've bundled it to include the following missing plugins:
	lastfmradio libnotify playlistsort tagedit
No other changes were made.

Requires gmpc, gob2, json-glib, and optionally several others:
avahi, xosd, lastfm, libnotify, and lirc.  If you have any of these,
you can run the script with VARIABLE=yes -- for example, if you have
both avahi and libnotify installed, you would do this:
	AVAHI=yes LIBNOTIFY=yes ./gmpc-plugins.SlackBuild
