# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

ulogd: You get an init script free of charge: /etc/rc.d/rc.ulogd --
ulogd: You'll just have to make it executable and call it from one of your
ulogd: init scripts.  Also, have a look at /etc/ulogd.conf - it works fine
ulogd: with the default, but you might want to customize it.
