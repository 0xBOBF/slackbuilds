Cfengine is an autonomous agent (a software robot).

Written by Mark Burgess, a Professor of Network and System Administration
at Oslo University College, Norway.

It is used to implement policy-based configuration management on open systems
(Unix-like environments) through the interpretation of its own declarative
language.

It emphasizes an 'immunological' viewpoint, making its modus operandi
convergence to a stable state.

Note: Even though an rc file is included, at least an update.conf is
needed as well (a sample is also included in the package).
