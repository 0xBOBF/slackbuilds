OpenVAS stands for Open Vulnerability Assessment System and is a network
security scanner with associated tools like a graphical user front-end. The
core component is a server with a set of network vulnerability tests (NVTs)
to detect security problems in remote systems and applications.

OpenVAS products are Free Software under GNU GPL and a fork of Nessus.

This package provides the OpenVAS server plugins. To build OpenVAS server,
you have to compile and install the packages in the the following sequence:
 1. openvas-libraries
 2. openvas-libnasl
 3. openvas-server
 4. openvas-plugins

You need rsync to use the openvas-nvt-sync update command.
This is the last release of openvas-plugins, next openvas-server and client
releases will no longer use this pacakge: the plugins will be downloaded
manually with the openvas-nvt-sync command.
