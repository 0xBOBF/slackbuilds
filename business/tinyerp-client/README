Tiny ERP is a free enterprise management software package. It covers all
domains for small to medium businesses; accounting, stock management,
sales, customer relationship, purchases, project management, etcetera.
This is the client application.

tinyerp-client requires tinyerp-server. Additionally, you will get an
error on startup if you do not have matplotlib installed; however, the
only functionality lost is presenting graphs. Both tinyerp-server and
matplotlib are available from SlackBuilds.org.
