eduke32_hires_pack: eduke32_hires_pack (Duke3D High Resolution Pack)
eduke32_hires_pack: The Duke3D High Resolution Pack allows you to use much better looking
eduke32_hires_pack: textures than the original game (released back in 1996) had to offer
eduke32_hires_pack: in the first place. It also introduces 3D model replacements for the
eduke32_hires_pack: old enemies/weapons/items sprites. In combination with an OpenGL port
eduke32_hires_pack: like JFDuke3D or EDuke32, this gives Duke Nukem 3D a modernized, more
eduke32_hires_pack: appealing look and even motivates Duke veterans to play through the
eduke32_hires_pack: original episodes once again.
eduke32_hires_pack:
eduke32_hires_pack: This package is intended for use with the eduke32 package from
eduke32_hires_pack: slackbuilds.org, but may also be used with other Duke3D source ports.
