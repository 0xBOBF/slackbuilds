This is a very simple program that will adjust the speed of your CPU
depending on system load.  It works as a client of the CPUFreq driver.
It is designed for use with CPU's supporting AMD's PowerNow power
management scheme, as it's algorithm works better if there are more
than two CPU speeds available.  (aka, ARM, AMD K6/K7, Via C3, and
Crusoe as opposed to traditional Intel and Ultrasparc).

Powernowd uses the userspace governor, which is included in the Slackware
kernel images.

It is not wise to run two concurrent cpu frequency adjusting programs,
for example, cpufreqd and powernowd simultaneously.
