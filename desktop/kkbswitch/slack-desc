# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

kkbswitch: KKBSwitch (Keyboard layout indicator)
kkbswitch:
kkbswitch: KKBSwitch is a keyboard layout indicator for KDE 2 or 3.  It is 
kkbswitch: usefull when you have configured the XKeyboard extension of your 
kkbswitch: X Server to have more than one keyboard group (layout), for example
kkbswitch: US/ASCII and Russian. KKBSwitch displays an icon in the system tray 
kkbswitch: that indicates which layout is currently active.  Note that 
kkbswitch: KBSwitch does not help you configure XKeyboard, it merely serves 
kkbswitch: as the indicator of the current layout. You still have to configure
kkbswitch: XKeyboard by editing the XF86Config file.
