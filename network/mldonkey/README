MLDonkey is an open source, free software multi-network
peer-to-peer application. 

MLDonkey requires "ocaml" to be builded, and also requires
"lablgtk" if you want to enable its GUI. There's a SlackBuild 
at SlackBuilds.org for each one.

By default, this SlackBuild is going to build MLdonkey without
its GUI. If you want to enable MLDonkey's GUI, you'll have to
enable it with the GUIOPT variable, which can have 'oldgui',
'newgui1' or 'newgui2' as values.  For example, if you want to
build mldonkey with "oldgui" then execute the build script 
as follows:
  GUIOPT=oldgui ./mldonkey.SlackBuild
