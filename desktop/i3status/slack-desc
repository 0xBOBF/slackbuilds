# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

i3status: i3status (status line generator for dzen2 and xmobar)
i3status: 
i3status: i3status is a small program (less than 1000 SLOC) for generating a 
i3status: status bar for dzen2, xmobar, or similar programs.  It is designed 
i3status: to be very efficient by issuing a very small number of system calls, 
i3status: as one generally wants to update such a status line every second. 
i3status: This ensures that even under high load, your status bar is updated 
i3status: correctly.  Also, it saves a bit of energy by not hogging your CPU 
i3status: as much as spawning the corresponding amount of shell commands would.
