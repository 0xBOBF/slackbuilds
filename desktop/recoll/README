recoll (personal full text search tool)

Recoll is a personal full text search tool for Unix/Linux.  It is based
on the very strong Xapian backend, for which it provides an easy to use, 
feature-rich, easy administration, QT graphical interface.

This requires xapian-core, with optional dependencies of antiword, unrtf,
and exiftool (all available at SlackBuilds.org).

NOTE: As of the time of writing, recoll depends on version 0.9.10 of
xapian-core, the newer 1.0.0 release does NOT work with this version 
of recoll.

After installing the package you should create the file 
$HOME/.recoll/recoll.conf and modify it to your needs, especially the 
"topdirs" where recoll looks for files to index. See "man recoll.conf" 
for details.
