- jasspa is a descendant of the original microemacs, with a lot of additions

- there is a 'build' script in the distribution which autodetects a few
  things, so I use this script.
  - but if I use this script I have to patch linux2.gmk and linux26.gmk 
  
- there is a macro package called  jasspa-metree-20$VERSION-2.tar.gz  which is
  needed to use the editor. (link in README)

- there is a special version called nanoemacs (ne) which is a small macro-less
  minimal  version. I do not build this  version  because I think it is not so
  useful.

- this is my second editor after vim
