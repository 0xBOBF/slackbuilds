Bootchart provides a shell script to be run by the kernel in the init phase. 
The script will run in background and collect process information, CPU 
statistics and disk usage statistics from the /proc file system. 
The performance data are stored in memory and are written to disk once the 
boot process completes.

The boot log file is later processed using a Java application which builds 
the process tree and renders a performance chart in different formats (png, 
svg, eps).

This requires apache-ant, and you need the jdk package from /extra installed.

After installation, to run bootchartd append the following boot option:
	init=/sbin/bootchartd
You may want to edit your lilo configuration file.  Also note that this will 
not work if run from a kernel using an initrd - you must use one of the 
huge* kernels (or a custom kernel).
