Xautolock monitors console activity under the X window system, and
fires up a program of your choice if nothing happens during a
user configurable period of time. You can use this to automatically
start up a screen locker in case you tend to forget to do so manually
before having a coffee break.

Xautolock will typically be used to lock the screen but it really
doesn't care what program you make it start. The only real assumption
made by xautolock is that a new countdown starts as soon as the
locker exits. 

I use xautolock with xlockmore in this way:

    xautolock -time 10 -locker xlock

Note: this script calls /usr/X11R6/bin/xmkmf, which requires that directory
      to be in your $PATH.  Therefore, you will almost certainly need to
      do "su -" instead of just "su" to build this.

If you have any questions or comments about this script you are free to
