# This should allow you to either pass a different value of OOLANG when you
# run the script (OOLANG=pt-BR ./openoffice.org.SlackBuild for example) or
# change it in this script.  Note that you will need to have the correct
# tarball in the build directory for this to work...
# You can get localized tarballs from the following location:
# ftp://ftp.free.fr/mirrors/ftp.openoffice.org/localized/$OOLANG/$VERSION/
# Thanks to Niki Kovacs for finding this :-)

# If you want to disable java support by removing executable permissions
# form OOo's java loader (this will not affect other apps), set this
# variable to "YES"   Default is "NO"
# According to Fred Emmott, this is *highly* desirable on 64 bit systems
DISABLE_JAVA=${DISABLE_JAVA:-NO}

# If you want to include the new experimental Optimization Solver, 
# download "scsolver.uno.zip" from the following location:
# http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Optimization_Solver
# and place it in the same directory as the SlackBuild script ($CWD)
# Set the following variable to "YES"   Default is "NO"
ADD_SOLVER=${ADD_SOLVER:-NO}

# Yes, I know there is a Slackware integration file in the desktop-integration
# directory, but it's worthless to us.  I mailed the maintainer of this
# module with suggestions on how to make it more compliant with standard 
# Slackware packaging, but I received no response.  Anyway, to sum up, we're 
# not using that file...

set -e # Require the script to exit if any command fails

# Ignore this - it's just to get the toplevel directory name of the
