compiz-plugins-extra is an optional plugin package for Compiz Fusion. Here, you'll
find plugins that are not essential to the operation of other plugins, and for
which you might not have an immediate use, but if you're looking for something
interesting to try, this is a good place to start. Most of the plugins in this
package allow you to customise finer visual details such as blurring,
reflection, the top and bottom faces of the desktop cube, and the cube's
environment. This package also offers advanced window management options such
as the ability to group related windows, see a fading trail of your most
recently used windows, and place windows on a Dashboard-like widget layer.
