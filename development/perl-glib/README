Glib (perl module)

This module provides perl access to Glib and GLib's 
GObject libraries.

In order to build it from source, you'll also need
  ExtUtils::Depends >= 0.200 (perl-extutils-depends)
  ExtUtils::PkgConfig >= 1.00 (perl-extutils-pkgconfig)
Both of these are also available from SlackBuilds.org.
