byacc (Berkeley Yacc parser generator)

Berkeley Yacc is an LALR(1) parser generator.  Berkeley Yacc
has been made as compatible as possible with AT&T Yacc.  Berkeley
Yacc can accept any input specification that conforms to the AT&T
Yacc documentation.  Specifications that take advantage of
undocumented features of AT&T Yacc will probably be rejected.

Please note that this will install the executable as byacc, in
order not to conflict with the bison package that ships with Slack
