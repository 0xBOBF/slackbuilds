WeeChat is a light & fast multilingual curses-based multiplatform IRC client.

WeeChat supports:
    DCC files and chats, multi-server connections, background connections,
    IPv6, SSL, proxy, auto-reconnection, DCC2, nicklist, window splitting,
    FIFO pipe for remote control, aspell, perl, python, ruby, nick auto-
    completion, lag indication, auto-logging, client upgrades without
    dropping connections.

WeeChat will build with support for:
    aspell, perl scripting, python scripting, ruby scripting, and gnutls
    depending on whether or not they are installed on the system on which
    WeeChat is built.

WeeChat supports lua scripting as well, but it hasn't been working in recent
    versions... even though lua may be installed the ./configure script
    will fail to detect it properly.  This is due to changes in recent
    versions of Lua and has not yet been fixed as of WeeChat 0.2.1
