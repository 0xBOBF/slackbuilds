enblend: Enblend (Image Blending with Multiresolution Splines)
enblend: 
enblend: Enblend is a tool for compositing images. Given a set of images that
enblend: overlap in some irregular way, Enblend overlays them in such a way
enblend: that the seam between the images is invisible, or at least very
enblend: difficult to see. Enblend does not line up the images for you. Use a
enblend: tool like Hugin to do that.
