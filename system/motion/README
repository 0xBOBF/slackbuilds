Motion is a program that monitors the video signal from one or more
cameras and is able to detect if a significant part of the picture
has changed. Or in other words, it can detect motion.

Motion is a command line based tool. It has no graphical user
interface. Everything is setup via the command line or via a set of
configuration files.

Optional dependencies are ffmpeg and postgresql.

Once installed, please be sure to read /usr/doc/motion-3.2.9/README for
any configuration help.
