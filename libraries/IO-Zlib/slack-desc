# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

IO-Zlib: IO-Zlib (perl IO:: style interface to Compress::Zlib)
IO-Zlib:
IO-Zlib: Perl IO::Zlib "provides an IO:: style interface to Compress::Zlib
IO-Zlib: and hence to gzip/zlib compressed files.  It provides many of the
IO-Zlib: same methods as the IO::Handle interface.  Starting from IO::Zlib
IO-Zlib: version 1.02, IO::Zlib can also use an external gzip command."
