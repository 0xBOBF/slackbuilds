flash-player-plugin (flash plugin for web browsers)

********************* NOTE! ***********************
This version of the flash-plugin has known security
issues, but since Adobe has not (yet?) released a
version for x86_64, it will not be updated here until
they do.  If you run 32bit Slackware, feel free to
use the latest version from Adobe (and change the
VERSION string appropriately).
