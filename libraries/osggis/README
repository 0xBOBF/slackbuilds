osgGIS a software package that enables you to access GIS vector data
and visualize it in an OpenSceneGraph application. With osgGIS, you
could:
    * Read vector data from a variety of sources and generate OSG
      geometry
    * Create custom geometry compilation scripts by using built-in
      filters or by building your own custom filters
    * Create scalable, paged data layers from GIS vector data

osgGIS is dependent upon OpenSceneGraph and gdal packages.
