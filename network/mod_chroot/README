mod_chroot allows you to run Apache in a chroot jail with no additional files.
This makes running Apache in a chroot environment easy.

The chroot() system call is performed at the end of startup procedure - when
all libraries are loaded and log files open. No need for a special directory
hierarchy (containing /dev, /lib, /etc...), unless an external handler, such
as suEXEC or suPHP, is being used, or system()-like functions are in use.

This package pre-creates /var/chroot/httpd with just enough subdirs to enable
the stock Slackware config to run. Provided /etc/httpd/httpd.conf contains:

ChrootDir /var/chroot/httpd
LoadModule chroot_module lib/httpd/modules/mod_chroot.so

And the following (or similar) commands where run:

mount -o nosuid,nodev --bind /var/run/httpd /var/chroot/httpd/var/run/httpd
mount -o nosuid,nodev --bind /srv /var/chroot/httpd/srv
mount --bind /var/www /var/chroot/httpd/var/www

Above commands maybe added to rc.local.
