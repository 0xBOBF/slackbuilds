KVM (for Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution
for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions (Intel VT
or AMD-V). It consists of a loadable kernel module, kvm.ko, that provides
the core virtualization infrastructure and a processor specific module,
kvm-intel.ko or kvm-amd.ko. KVM also requires a modified QEMU although
work is underway to get the required changes upstream.

Using KVM, one can run multiple virtual machines running unmodified Linux
or Windows images. Each virtual machine has private virtualized hardware:
a network card, disk, graphics adapter, etc.

Reload udev rules.  # /etc/rc.d/rc.udev reload

How use kvm with a non-privileged user:

Add kvm group # groupadd kvm
Add user to kvm group. Re-login.

# modprobe kvm-intel or # modprobe kvm-amd
