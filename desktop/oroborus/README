Oroborus is a small yet fully featured GNOME compliant window manager for the
X Window System. It is distributed under the GPL (see LICENSE for more details).

The main aim of Oroborus is to be small and light with very few fancy features,
so there are no docks, no taskbars, no root menus and no icons. These can be
added quite easily by either using Oroborus with GNOME or using some other
applications that provide the required functionality.

Oroborus reads its defaults from either /usr/share/oroborus/defaults or 
$HOME/.oroborusrc. An example rc file is included in /usr/doc/oroborus-$VERSION
Themes and schemes can be found in /usr/share/oroborus.

You may also want to install the keylaunch, deskmenu, and desklaunch programs 
found on the oroborus home page.
