Antimicro is a GUI application to intercept gamepad signals and
translate them to keyboard events, so that you can control games that
do not have native gamepad support.

It works for games you're playing on Linux or with WINE.

Profiles
--------

Some pre-built game controller profiles are available here:

These allow you to download button mappings for popular games so that
you don't have to configure them yourself.
