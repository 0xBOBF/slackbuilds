GoogleEarth (Google's famous virtual globe)

Google Earth is a virtual globe program. It maps a version of the
Earth by the superimposition of images obtained from satellite 
imagery, aerial photography and GIS over a 3D globe. You point 
and zoom to any place on the planet that you want to explore.
Satellite images and local facts zoom into view. Tap into Google
search to show local points of interest and facts. Zoom to a 
specific address to check out an apartment or hotel. View driving
directions and even fly along your route.

The degree of resolution available is based somewhat on the points 
of interest, but most land (except for some islands) is covered in at 
least 15 meters of resolution. 

Note that Google updates the GoogleEarth executable without changing
the download link location.  Therefore, this script is subject to 
failing at any time due to the fact that you might get a newer version
of GoogleEarth than what the script is designed to use.

When running GoogleEarth for the first time, you will see an error
message stating that it is unable to find the Bitstream Vera fonts.
This should be safe to ignore - it will use other fonts (and the
DejaVu fonts included with Slackware are based on the Bitstream fonts).
