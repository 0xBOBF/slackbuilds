Kipi Plugins are additional functions for the KDE Images
Managment Host Programs (digiKam, KimDaBa, ShowImg,
and Gwenview). They can add extra menus and shortcuts,
and extend the host programs features. You can install
as many or as few as you like, from within host programs.

exiv2, libgphoto2, libkdcraw, libkexiv2, and libkipi (also
available at SBo) are required to build Kipi Plugins.
