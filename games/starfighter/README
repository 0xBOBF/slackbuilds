Project: Starfighter is an old school 2D shoot 'em up. In the game you take
on the role of a rebel pilot called Chris, who is attempting to overthrow a
military corporation called Weapco. Weapco has seized control of the known
universe and currently rules it with an iron fist. Chris can no longer
stand back and watch as millions of people suffer and die. He steals an
experimental craft known as "Firefly" and begins his mission to fight his
way to Sol, freeing key systems along the way. The game opens with Chris
attempting to escape a Weapco patrol that has intercepted him.

This game depends on SDL, SDL_image, and SDL_mixer. All dependancies are
included in the Slackware 12.2 SDL packages.
