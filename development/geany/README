Geany is a small and lightweight Integrated Development Environment.
It was developed to  provide a  small  and fast  IDE, which  has only 
a few dependencies from other packages. It supports many filetypes 
and has some nice features.

Geany can optionally be built with support for virtual terminals if 
you have gnome's vte installed (vte has no other gnome dependencies, 
and it is available from SlackBuilds.org).
