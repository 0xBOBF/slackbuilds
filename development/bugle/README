BuGLe is a tool for OpenGL debugging, implemented as a wrapper library
that sits between your program and OpenGL. While still in development,
it can already do the following:
    * Dump a textual log of all GL calls made.
    * Take a screenshot or capture a video.
    * Call glGetError after each call to check for errors, and wrap
      glGetError so that this checking is transparent to your program.
    * Capture and display statistics (such as frame rate)
    * Force a wireframe mode
    * Recover a backtrace from segmentation faults inside the driver,
      even if the driver is compiled without symbols.

In addition, there is a debugger (gldb) that lets you set breakpoints
and examine backtraces. It also lets you examine OpenGL state, enable
and disable filters, and drop into gdb to see what is going wrong. A
GUI version of the debugger (gldb-gui) is currently in development,
and a preliminary version is available with the latest releases. It
features a texture viewer and a shader viewer.
