The UFRaw (Unidentified Flying Raw) is a tool for reading and manipulating 
raw images from digital cameras.  It supports most of the existing raw 
formats (any format supported by DCRaw).  UFRaw can be used on its own or 
as a Gimp plug-in.

UFRaw depends on dcraw, which is also available at SlackBuilds.org.
However, you can add "--enable-extras" to the configure arguments in the 
build script to use the included dcraw. 
An optional dependency is exiv2 (available at SlackBuilds.org) if you want 
the ability to read exif data with ufraw.
