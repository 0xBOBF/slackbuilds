DeSmuME is a Nintendo DS emulator running homebrew demos and commercial games.

This requires gtkglext.

Optionally DeSmuMe can use zziplib if installed.

Note about Nvidia drivers:
DeSmuMe doesn't compile with Nvidia's OpenGL header files.  To compile DeSmuMe
on computers with SlackBuilds.org Nvidia Drivers run the following commands:

nvidia-switch --xorg
./desmume.SlackBuild
nvidia-switch --nvidia
