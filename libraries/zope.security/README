zope.security (Zope Security Framework)

The Security framework provides a generic mechanism to implement
security policies on Python objects.

This requires zope.i18nmessageid, zope.interface, zope.proxy,
zope.schema, zope.configuration, zope.component and zope.location.

To build, this requires pysetuptools.
