xosd: xosd (On Screen Display)
xosd:
xosd: XOSD displays text on your screen, sounds simple right? The
xosd: difference is it is unmanaged and shaped, so it appears transparent.
xosd: This gives the effect of an On Screen Display, like your TV/VCR etc.
xosd: The package also includes an xmms plugin, which automatically
xosd: displays various interesting things as they change (song name,
xosd: volume etc...)
