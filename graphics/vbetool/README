vbetool uses lrmi in order to run code from the video BIOS. Currently, 
it is able to alter DPMS states, save/restore video card state, and 
attempt to initialize the video card from scratch. It exists primarily 
in order to increase the chances of successfully recovering video state 
after an ACPI S3 suspend.
