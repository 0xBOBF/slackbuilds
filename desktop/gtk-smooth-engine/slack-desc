# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

gtk-smooth-engine: Smooth GTK1/GTK2 Theme Engine is a simple theme
gtk-smooth-engine: engine intended to be smooth, fast, and highly
gtk-smooth-engine: configurable, such that it could eventually mimic
gtk-smooth-engine: most, if not all, major theme engines to high
gtk-smooth-engine: degree of acuracy, while still retaining a small
gtk-smooth-engine: footprint.
