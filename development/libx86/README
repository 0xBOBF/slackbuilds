libx86 - a hardware-independent library for executing real-mode x86 code

It's often useful to be able to make real-mode x86 BIOS calls from
userland. lrmi provides a simple interface to this for x86 machines, but
this doesn't help on other platforms. libx86 provides the lrmi interface,
but will also run on platforms such as amd64 and alpha.
