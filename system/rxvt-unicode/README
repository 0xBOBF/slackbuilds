rxvt-unicode is a clone of the well known terminal emulator rxvt 
modified to store text in Unicode and to use locale-correct input 
and output. It also supports mixing multiple fonts at the same time, 
including Xft fonts, real transparency, and an optional embedded 
Perl interpreter that allows you to extend your terminal easily.
