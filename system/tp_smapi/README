tp_smapi (SMAPI BIOS access for ThinkPad Laptops)

ThinkPad laptops include a proprietary interface called SMAPI BIOS 
(System Management Application Program Interface) which provides some
hardware control functionality that is not accessible by other means.

WARNING: 
This driver uses undocumented features and direct hardware access.
It thus cannot be guaranteed to work, and may cause arbitrary damage
(especially to models on which it wasn't tested). 

NOTES:
* There's a patch (patches/tp_smapi-0.40-x200-x200s-support.patch) to
add axis inversion handling for thinkpads x200 and x200s but since
this patch *does not* come from upstream its not applied by default
so use it at your own risk. Edit the SlackBuild to apply it.
