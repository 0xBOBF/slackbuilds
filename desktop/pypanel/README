PyPanel is a lightweight panel/taskbar written in Python and C for X11
window managers. It can be easily customized to match any desktop
theme or taste. It works with WindowMaker and EWMH-compliant WMs
(Kahakai, Openbox, FVWM, PekWM, etc).

NOTE:  The pypanel.SlackBuild has support for an optional third-party
patch which introduces a STARTUP_DELAY variable that makes pypanel
load after an interval of time.  This is useful in case the window
manager is slow to load up before pypanel starts.

Pypanel requires python-xlib and imlib2.
