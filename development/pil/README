The Python Imaging Library (PIL) provides image processing facilities
to Python programs. The library supports many file formats, and
provides powerful image processing.

Compiling the Python Imaging Library does not require any libraries
outside Slackware Linux. If libjpeg-6b is installed, JPEG support
is included. For PNG support zlib is required.
