# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

cvsps: CVSps is a program for generating "patchset" information from a CVS
cvsps: repository. A patchset in this case is defined as a set of changes
cvsps: made to a collection of files, and all committed at the same time
cvsps: (using a single "cvs commit" command). This information is valuable
cvsps: to seeing the big picture of the evolution of a cvs project. While
cvsps: cvs tracks revision information, it is often difficult to see what
cvsps: changes were committed "atomically" to the repository.
