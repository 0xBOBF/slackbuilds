perl-Net-Daemon (perl extension for portable daemons)

Net::Daemon is an abstract base class for implementing portable
server applications in a very simple way. The module is designed
for Perl 5.005 and threads, but can work with fork() and Perl 5.004.
It offers methods for the most common tasks a daemon needs.
