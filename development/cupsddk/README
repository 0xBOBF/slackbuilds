The CUPS Driver Development Kit (DDK) provides a suite of standard drivers, a 
PPD file compiler, and other utilities that can be used to develop printer 
drivers for CUPS and other printing environments. CUPS provides a portable 
printing layer for UNIX(R)-based operating systems. The CUPS DDK provides 
the means for mass-producing PPD files and drivers/filters for CUPS-based 
printer drivers.
