Midori is a lightweight, webkit-based web browser.

Since midori is still in heavy development, an "updated" version
can be grabbed via git and making minor changes to the buildscript:

git clone http://software.twotoasts.de/media/midori.git midori

Note: To build midori, libsexy, libunique and webkit are required, all of 
which are available at slackbuilds.org.

When upgrading from 0.2.2 to 0.2.6, be aware the config file for libadblock
in midori has moved from /etc/midori to /etc/xdg/midori/. If you have a
custom config, you will need to manually move it over.
