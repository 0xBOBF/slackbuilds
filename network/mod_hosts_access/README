mod_hosts_access

This is a DSO (dynamically shared object) module for the Apache webserver
that uses libwrap (TCP Wrapper) to check if the connecting hosts is allowed.

To enable it, add to /etc/apache/httpd.conf following lines:

LoadModule hosts_access_module libexec/apache/mod_hosts_access.so
AddModule mod_hosts_access.c

At appropriate places (i.e. where other modules are loaded similarly).

The /etc/hosts.{allow,deny} access control checking for the "httpd" service
can now be enabled or disabled on a per directory basis, by adding HostsAccess
directive to its declaration, e.g.:

# First, we configure the "default" to be a very restrictive set of
# permissions.
#
<Directory />
    HostsAccess On
    Options FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None
</Directory>

The same can be done in a .htaccess file if AllowOverride Limit has been set.
