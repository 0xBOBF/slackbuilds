Catfish is a handy file searching tool for linux and unix.
Basically it is a frontend for different search engines (daemons)
which provides a unified interface. The interface is intentionally
lightweight and simple, using only GTK+ 2. You can configure it to
your needs by using several command line options.

pyxdg (available at SBo) is an optional build time dependency.
