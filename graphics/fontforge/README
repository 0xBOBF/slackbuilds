FontForge is an outline font editor that lets you create your own postscript, 
truetype, opentype, cid-keyed, multi-master, cff, svg and bitmap (bdf, FON, 
NFNT) fonts, or edit existing ones. It also lets you convert one format to 
another. FontForge has support for many Macintosh font formats.

From the README-unix file inside the source: 
  If you want to edit CID-keyed fonts (for CJK fonts) you may want to pull
  down the cidmap package from http://fontforge.sf.net/cidmaps.tgz
If you download this file and place it in the directory with the SlackBuild
script, the script will automatically place the cidmaps inside the package.
