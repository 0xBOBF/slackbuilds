The KontrollerLab is a tool which can be used for developing
ATMEL AVR microcontrollers software.

The KontrollerLab uses these tools to make developing easier:
    * Avr-gcc and helper programs to compile the C files,
      link the object files, and assemble the ASM files.
    * Uisp and avrdude to upload and download the programs.
    * Built-in debugger for PC-only and in-circuit debugging,
      currently at an early stage. [05/28/07]
    * Serial terminal embedded in the IDE to ease debugging.
    * Kate as the editor embedded in the IDE.
