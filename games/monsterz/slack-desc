# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

monsterz: monsterz (an puzzle game, similar to Bejeweled or Zookeeper)
monsterz:
monsterz: The goal of the game is to create rows of similar monsters, either
monsterz: horizontally or vertically. The only allowed move is the swap of two
monsterz: adjacent monsters, on the condition that it creates a row of three or
monsterz: more. When alignments are cleared, pieces fall from the top of the
monsterz: screen to fill the board again. Chain reactions earn you even more
monsterz: points.
