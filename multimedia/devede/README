DeVeDe (create video CDs and DVDs)

DeVeDe is a program to create video DVDs and CDs (VCD, sVCD, or CVD),
suitable for home players from any number of video files, in any of
the formats supported by MPlayer. 

DeVeDe requires dvdauthor, vcdimager, and MPlayer.

Since new versions of DeVeDe are released quite frequently, but its installer
script is usually not modified, it is possible to pass the version number to the
SlackBuild script with VERSION=<version>
