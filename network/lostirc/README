LostIRC is a simple, yet very useful IRC client. It has features such as
tab-autocompletion, multiple server support, automatic joining of
servers/channels, logging and DCC sending which should cover the needs of
most people. Another goal that the application has in mind, is 100% keyboard
controlability. It was written using the gtkmm GUI library.

If it has your interest, there's an IRC channel for LostIRC where you can
get help/support or just a small chat on irc.freenode.net, #lostirc.

This program requires gtkmm and libsigc++, both available at SlackBuilds.org
