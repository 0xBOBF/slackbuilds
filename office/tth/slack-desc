# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

tth: TTH translates TeX, the predominant mark-up language for
tth: expressing mathematics, into HTML, the language of world-wide-web
tth: browsers. It thereby enables mathematical documents to be made
tth: available on the web. Document structure, using either the Plain
tth: or LaTeX macro packages, is also translated and incorporated in
tth: the form of hyperlinks.
