smc (Secret Maryo Chronicles)

Secret Maryo Chronicles is an Open Source two-dimensional platform game 
with a style designed similar to classic sidescroller games such as Super 
Mario Bros.  It uses the platform independent library SDL and, since 
version 0.98, the OpenGL accelerated Graphics Renderer. The game is 
developed in C++.

** REQUIRES **
To compile this game you will need OpenGL (with hardware acceleration 
enabled), CEGUI, and Boost.  Make sure CEGUI is compiled *WITHOUT* DevIL 
support (or just make sure it is not the default image codec) and *WITH* 
either FreeImage or SILLY codec support (FreeImage is the most 
recommended choice).  Also, the background music for this game, if desired,
must be installed as a separate package.  SlackBuilds for the music pack, 
Boost, FreeImage, and CEGUI can all be found on SlackBuilds.org.

*NOTE* If you are using a Boost version prior to 1.36 you should try using 
this SlackBuild without the boost patch by executing

PATCHBOOST=NO ./smc.SlackBuild
