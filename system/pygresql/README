PyGreSQL is a PostgreSQL access for Python.

PyGreSQL is a Python module that interfaces to a PostgreSQL database. It
embeds the PostgreSQL query library to allow easy use of the powerful
PostgreSQL features from a Python script. 

PyGreSQL provides two different APIs, the "classic" interface provided by the
pg module and the newer DB-API 2.0 compliant interface provided by the pgdb
module.

This SlackBuild requires that PostgreSQL is installed to build, and to be
useful. A PostgreSQL SlackBuild is available from SlackBuilds.org.
