madwifi - a Linux kernel device driver for Wireless LAN chipsets from Atheros.

A wireless card compatibility matrix is available at:
http://madwifi.org/wiki/Compatibility

By default the script will build the madwifi kernel module for the currently
running kernel.  If you would like to build the madwifi driver for a different
kernel version, two things are required:
    1) kernel source in /usr/src/linux-<version>
    2) run the script as: KERNELVERSION=<version> sh madwifi-driver.SlackBuild
In place of <version> use only the version, not the full path. The <version>
string from 1) and 2) must be identical.
    Example: KERNELVERSION=2.6.22.7
The kernel module will then be installed to /lib/modules/<version>/....
You may use this SlackBuild to build the madwifi module for as many *different*
kernels as you like and they can be installed alongside each other without
conflict.

Requirements:

Kernel requirements:
    Linux Kernel 2.4.23+ or 2.6.x series 
    Kernel source and headers of running kernel 
    No module versioning support 
        option CONFIG_MODVERSIONS 
    Wireless Extensions support in kernel 
        v14+ required, v17+ recommended; option CONFIG_NET_RADIO 
    Sysctl support in kernel 
        option CONFIG_SYSCTL 
    Crypto API support in kernel 
        option CONFIG_CRYPTO 
    HMAC support 
        option CONFIG_CRYPTO_HMAC 
    AES support (for WPA networks) 
        option CONFIG_CRYPTO_AES

Requirements for configuring the wireless card:
  madwifi-tools -- suite of tools designed specifically for madwifi-supported cards
  iwconfig -- part of "wireless-tools" package in N series
  wpa_supplicant -- for WPA encrypted networks - in N package series
