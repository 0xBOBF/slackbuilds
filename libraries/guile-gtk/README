This is some glue code to make GTK accessible from Guile (1.6.4 or up).  It
provides a convenient interface for Scheme programmers to develop graphical
user interfaces.  This version of guile-gtk is stripped down and intended for
people who want to use GTK without Gnome.

GtkGLArea is required to build guile-gtk.

guile-gtk version 0.60 was the last to support GTK+-1.2.  To install this
version instead, download the source from here:
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/guile-gtk/guile-gtk-0.60.tar.gz
md5sum: 61a2e4d9326b40b65ce6c68bf1feb5db

Installation:
VERSION=0.60 ./guile-gtk.SlackBuild

Note that installing both version 0.60 and the latest version will result in
some common files getting clobbered.  GtkGLArea should not be necessary for
version 0.60 (but possibly an older version of GtkGLArea), as it is already
handicapped with the removal of gdk-pixbuf from Slackware beginning with
Slackware 12.0.
