Prelink is a program that modifies ELF shared libraries and ELF dynamically 
linked binaries in such a way that the time needed for the dynamic linker to 
perform relocations at startup significantly decreases.  Due to fewer 
relocations, the run-time memory consumption decreases as well (especially 
the number of unshareable pages).  The prelinking information is only used 
at startup time if none of the dependent libraries have changed since 
prelinking; otherwise, programs are relocated normally.

There is a script in the prelink documentation directory that is suitable 
for a cron job.  Before setting up a cron job, first run prelink on the 
system and then read the script and modify it as needed.

This requires libelf.
