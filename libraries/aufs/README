Aufs is a stackable unification filesystem such as Unionfs, which unifies 
several directories and provides a merged single directory.

If you build on a multicore system, add JOBS={core #} to enable parallel 
compilation; for example, to start 4 build jobs simultaneously, do:
	JOBS=4 ./aufs.SlackBuild

You can build this for a different kernel than the one which happens to be
currently running - see the build script for details.

Since there are no official aufs source tarballs, the download link refers 
to a tarball containing the CVS snapshot of version 20080128.
After talking with the aufs developer, we learned that Monday's snapshots 
are considered "releases" of aufs.  That being the case, you may certainly
decide to use a later cvs snapshot than what we have tested, but there are
no guarantees from us that it will compile cleanly or package properly.
If changes in the upstream cvs repository necessitate changes to our build
script, please let us know.

Note: The download link for the source tarball points to the SlackBuilds.org
      server; this is because the upstream sources are only available via
      cvs.
