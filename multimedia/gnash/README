Gnash is the GNU SWF movie player, which can be run standalone on the
desktop or an embedded device, as well as a plugin for several browsers.

Plugins are now disabled by default due to browsers removing support.

To enable the Mozilla NPAPI plugin, install xulrunner, then run
  NPAPI=yes ./gnash.SlackBuild

Optional but recommended deps are gst0-ffmpeg and gst0-plugins-ugly.
