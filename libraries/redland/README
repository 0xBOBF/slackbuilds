Redland is a library that provides a high-level interface for the
Resource Description Framework (RDF) allowing the RDF graph to be
parsed from XML, stored, queried and manipulated. Redland implements
each of the RDF concepts in its own class via an object based API,
reflected into the language APIs, currently C#, Java, Perl, PHP,
Python, Ruby and Tcl.

This requires raptor and rasqal, both of which are available at
SlackBuilds.org.
