dosemu is a DOS EMUlator

DOSEMU is a user-level program which uses certain special features
of the Linux kernel and the 80386 processor to run MS-DOS/FreeDOS
in what we in the biz call a 'DOS box'

This SlackBuild script needs two downloads: the dosemu source file, and
the dosemu-freedos-1.0-bin.tgz file, both available from the DOSEMU homepage.

This script does not build support for X by default - to enable X,
run the script as follows:
  WITH_X=yes ./dosemu.SlackBuild
