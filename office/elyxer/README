eLyXer (pronounced elixir) is a LyX to HTML converter.  Using eLyXer, you
can build a web representation of your documentation written with LyX.

As of version 1.2.0, eLyXer is installed as a script instead of a Python
module.  After installation, in Lyx, select Tools->Reconfigure to configure
the HTML export to use the new script.
