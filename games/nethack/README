Nethack is a rogue-like dungeon exploration game.

Originally Nethack was written using a TTY interface.  The "graphics" are made 
up of ASCII characters.  This SlackBuild will build the TTY interface by default.

To build and use the X11 interface (which retains the tty interface) two things 
are required:
    1) run the SlackBuild with FLAVOR=_X11
       example: FLAVOR=_X11 sh nethack.SlackBuild
    2) if X is running either run these two commands as
       the user logged into X, or restart X:
       xrdb -merge /etc/X11/app-defaults/NetHack
       xset +fp /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc
       (I recommend restarting X and letting everything initialize properly)

To build and use the Qt interface (which retains the TTY and X11 interfaces) 
two things are required:
    1) run the SlackBuild with FLAVOR=_Qt
       example: FLAVOR=_Qt sh nethack.SlackBuild
    2) if X is running either run these two commands as
       the user logged into X, or restart X:
       xrdb -merge /etc/X11/app-defaults/NetHack
       xset +fp /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc
       (I recommend restarting X and letting everything initialize properly)

It is recommended that if you are using the Qt client that you copy 
/etc/nethack/nethackrc.qt to ~/.nethackrc post-install.  This will make the 
Qt client more "pretty" and usable.  The Nethack Guidbook is included in 
/usr/doc with this package, and is available at http://www.nethack.org.  
A full list of options and settings can be found in the Guidebook.  
In-game help can be accessed with the "?" key.

Nethack will choose its default mode in the order Qt > X11 > TTY.  You can 
run the interface of your choice with nethack-tty, nethack-x11, or nethack-qt 
depending on which interfaces you decided to build with FLAVOR.

Requirements:
  TTY interface: >=ncurses-5.0
  X11 interface: 
    >=ncurses-5.0 >=x11-6.9.0 >=x11-devel-6.9.0 
    >=x11-fonts-6.9.0-* (uses 'times' and 'fixed' fonts by default)
  Qt interface: All X11 requirements as well as >=qt-3.3.6
