star - unique standard tape archiver

star is a very fast tar(1) like tape archiver with improved functionality. 
star includes the first free implementation of POSIX.1-2001 extended tar 
headers, is built on top of libfind, includes a sophisticated diff command,
and has no limitation on filename length.
star automatically recognizes standard archive formats and non-standard 
formats, such as gnu, by their deviations from the standard. Star is able 
to archive and restore Access Control Lists for files using POSIX.1-2001 
extended headers.

It is recommended to build star using smake
(http://cdrecord.berlios.de/private/smake.html)

star installs under /opt/schily/ with other schily applications. Symlinks will
be created for gnutar, suntar, tar, and several others, so those can be used at
the command-line in favour of their GNU counterparts by modifying the order of
of PATH entries.
