Shutter is a feature-rich screenshot program. You can take a screenshot 
of a specific area, window, your whole screen, or even of a website - 
apply different effects to it, draw on it to highlight points, and then 
upload to an image hosting site, all within one window. Shutter is free, 
open-source, and licensed under GPL v3.

This requires perl-gtk2-imageview, perl-gnome2, perl-gnome2-wnck,
perl-gnome2-gconf, locale-gettext, perl-www-mechanize, perl-net-dbus,
perl-x11-protocol and perl-proc-processtable.

Optional requirement is perl-goo-canvas for drawing tool.
