lsh implements the secsh2 protocol

lsh provides secure connections through untrusted networks.
lsh is based on the specification for ssh2 and should (eventually)
be compatible.  lsh supports the Stanford SRP autentication protocol.

This requires liboop.

See README.SLACKWARE for additional information.
