Treesize for UNIX

A disk consumption analyzing tool, which sorts folders according
to theier physical occupied sizes. The perfect tool to help you 
obtaining more disk free space, on your harddrive, usb pen drive
or even on network folders. ( provided that they are mounted and 
you have access to them, of course. )

Just like du, it counts hard links just once and the space utilized
by diferent filesystems are not added together.
