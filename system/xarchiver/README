Xarchiver is a Desktop Environment independent archiver frontend. All common 
archive types are supported. RPM and ISO are handled without rpm or isodump 
executables. To run it, you only need GTK+2 libraries and obviously the 
various rar, arj and 7z for these archive types. All the others necessary 
archivers should be installed by default.
