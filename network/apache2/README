WARNING
This script builds a package that conflicts with Slackware's apache1 and
thus should be installed using upgradepkg if another version of apache
is currently installed.

Apache is the most popular web server in the known universe; over half
the servers on the Internet are running Apache or one of its variants.

By default, we build apache2 with the traditional "apache prefork" multi
processing module (MPM).  This is somewhat safer for the use of mod_php,
but can still carry some security risks (all your php scripts run as the
user configured to run apache2).  This is mitigated by default, as
apache2 runs as user apache2 and group apache2, which do not exist on
default Slackware installations and should have minimal privilages.

For enhanced multi-threaded performance, use "apache worker", but using
mod_php with "worker" is considered dangerous.  PHP Core is multi-thread
safe, but many PHP extensions are *NOT*.  To build apache2 with the
worker MPM, just run the script like so:

  # MPM_FLAVOR=worker; ./apache2.SlackBuild

Please note that this script does not build apache2 with SuEXEC support.
If you need this functionality, please read the following documentation
and make the necessary changes to the ./configure options in the script.
