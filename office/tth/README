TTH: the TeX to HTML translator

TTH translates TeX, the predominant mark-up language for
expressing mathematics, into HTML, the language of world-wide-web
browsers. It thereby enables mathematical documents to be made
available on the web. Document structure, using either the Plain
or LaTeX macro packages, is also translated and incorporated in
the form of hyperlinks.
