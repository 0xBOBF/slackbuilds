GNUstep-back provides a small set of functions used by the
GNUstep GUI library to interface to the actual window system
(X11, etc).  It also has a drawing engine which emulates common
PostScript functions.
This script builds the cairo backend due to a bug in the more
stable art backend that crashes all GUI applications.

Requires: gnustep-make gnustep-base gnustep-gui
