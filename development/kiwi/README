kiwi (a framework for developing graphical applications in Python)

kiwi is a framework composed of a set of modules, which eases Python
development using PyGTK. Kiwi makes graphical applications *much* 
faster to code, with good architecture and more Python-like bindings;
it also offers extended widgets based upon the original PyGTK widgets.

kiwi depends on PyGTK, which is available from SlackBuilds.org.
