OpenOffice.org is a full-featured open-source office suite that is compatible 
with all other major office software.
It is available in many languages, either through localised installer packages,
or through language packs.

If you haven't installed OpenOffice.org yet, it is recommended you download a
localised version of the installer.  See the SlackBuild for openoffice.org for
installing OpenOffice.org with local languages.
If you already have installed OpenOffice.org, you can install a language pack
using this SlackBuild.  Note that you will need to get the correct language
pack from the OpenOffice.org mirror - this script will build the 'nl' pack
by default.

This script builds a Slackware package from the official binary (RPM's) 
distributed by openoffice.org.  It needs OpenOffice.org installed
in /opt/openoffice.org2.4/.  The version of OpenOffice.org and the language 
pack must be the same.  You can find the latest version of OpenOffice.org and
the language packs on http://openoffice.org, and a SlackBuild script for it
here on SlackBuilds.org.

After installing a language pack, you can activate it in the options dialog
in Openoffice.org.
