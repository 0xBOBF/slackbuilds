btpd: BTPD (The BitTorrent Protocol Daemon)
btpd:
btpd: BTPD is a bittorrent  client consisting of a daemon and
btpd: client commands, which can be used to read and/or 
btpd: manipulate the daemon state. The daemon is capable of 
btpd: running several torrents simultaneously and only uses one
btpd: tcp port. It's fairly low on resource usage and should be 
btpd: perfect for file distribution sites. Efficient downloads and
btpd: ease of use makes this client a good choice for the casual 
btpd: user as well.
