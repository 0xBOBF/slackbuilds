WebKitGTK+ is a full-featured port of the WebKit rendering engine,
suitable for projects requiring any kind of web integration, from
hybrid HTML/CSS applications to full-fledged web browsers.

It offers WebKit's full functionality and is useful in a wide range
of systems from desktop computers to embedded systems like phones,
tablets, and televisions.

This package provides WebKit2 API and can co-exist with webkitgtk{3}.

NOTE:
If you need to build webkit2 API v4.1, use SOUP3=YES ./webkit2gtk.SlackBuild
It requires libsoup3 to be present before building this package.
