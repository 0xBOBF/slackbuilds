libdvdread provides a simple foundation for reading DVD video 
disks.  It provides the functionality that is required to access
many DVDs.  It parses IFO files, reads NAV-blocks, and performs
CSS authentication and descrambling.

libdvdread conflicts with libdvdnav, as a modified version of libdvdread 
is already included in libdvdnav.
