fly - Create images from a text description file.

fly is small program that takes a text input command file and creates an 
image file 'on the fly' to .gif, .jpg or .png format using the gd library.
fly is suited for creating images from bash or awk scripts.

This SlackBuild script patches the Makefile to remove an unused (obsolete)
linking to the old ttf (before freetype) library so we get a clean compile.
