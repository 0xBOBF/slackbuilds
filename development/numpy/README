The fundamental package needed for scientific computing with Python is
called NumPy.  This package contains:
    * a powerful N-dimensional array object
    * sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
    * basic linear algebra functions
    * basic Fourier transforms
    * sophisticated random number capabilities
    * tools for integrating Fortran code.

Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an
efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data.  Arbitrary
data-types can be defined.  This allows NumPy to seamlessly and
quickly integrate with a wide-variety of databases.
