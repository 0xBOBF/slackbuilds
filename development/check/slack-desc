check: Check is a unit test framework for C. It features a simple interface
check: for defining unit tests, putting little in the way of the
check: developer. Tests are run in a separate address space, so Check can
check: catch both assertion failures and code errors that cause segmentation
check: faults or other signals. The output from unit tests can be used within
check: source code editors and IDEs.
