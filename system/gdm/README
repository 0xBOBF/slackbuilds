The Gnome Display Manager (GDM) is a display manager that
implements all significant features required for managing
local and remote displays.   For full information about
GDM features, refer to the documentation.

The Sessions that gdm uses are installed in /etc/X11/gdm/Sessions.
Several example files are included for blackbox, fluxbox, fvwm2,
kde, twm, windowmaker, and xfce.

gdm requires libgnomecanvas and gnome-doc-utils, both of which
are also available at SlackBuilds.org
