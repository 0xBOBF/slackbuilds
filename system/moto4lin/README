moto4lin - Motorola for Linux
   
The moto4lin software is intended to be used with Motorola telephones
based on the P2K platform. It allows for filesystem access to the 
phone (for both uploading and downloading), and SEEM bit editing.

This program requires read/write access to the phone device. This can
be accomplished by either running as root, suid the executable, or
changing the permissions on the device. The second and third options
are covered on the moto4lin wiki.

Also, some newer phones may not work with this version of the code, 
and will need the latest code from SVN to work properly (this includes
the RAZRs).
