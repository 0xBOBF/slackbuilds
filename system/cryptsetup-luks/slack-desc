# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

cryptsetup-luks: cryptsetup-luks (disk encryption management) 
cryptsetup-luks: 
cryptsetup-luks: cryptsetup-luks is a utility that is used for managing encrypted
cryptsetup-luks: partitions and volumes. It was originally based on cryptsetup, and
cryptsetup-luks: adds support for LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup). LUKS is a standard
cryptsetup-luks: on-disk format that stores all necessary setup information in the 
cryptsetup-luks: partition header.
