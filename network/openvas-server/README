OpenVAS stands for Open Vulnerability Assessment System and is a network
security scanner with associated tools like a graphical user front-end. The
core component is a server with a set of network vulnerability tests (NVTs)
to detect security problems in remote systems and applications.

OpenVAS products are Free Software under GNU GPL and a fork of Nessus.

This package provides the OpenVAS server. To build OpenVAS server, you
have to compile and install the packages in the the following sequence:
 1. openvas-libraries
 2. openvas-libnasl
 3. openvas-server
 4. openvas-plugins

To run OpenVAS server at startup use something like this in your rc.local:

# Start openvasd if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.openvasd ]; then
  /etc/rc.d/rc.openvasd start
fi

and something smilar in your rc.local_shutdown to stop the service. Beware
it can take sometime to load all the plugins.
