rdiff-backup: rdiff-backup backs up one directory to another, possibly over a
rdiff-backup: network. The target directory ends up a copy of the source 
rdiff-backup: directory, but extra reverse diffs are stored in a special 
rdiff-backup: subdirectory of that target directory, so you can still recover 
rdiff-backup: files lost some time ago. The idea is to combine the best 
rdiff-backup: features of a mirror and an incremental backup.
