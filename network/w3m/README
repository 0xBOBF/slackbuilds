w3m is a World Wide Web (WWW) text based client. It has English and
Japanese help files and an option menu and can be configured to use
either language. It will display hypertext markup language (HTML)
documents containing links to files residing on the local system, as
well as files residing on remote systems. It can display HTML tables,
frames, and images, and supports tabbed browsing. In addition,
it can be used as a "pager" in much the same manner as "more" or
"less". Current versions of w3m run on Unix (Solaris, SunOS, HP-UX,
Linux, FreeBSD, and EWS4800) and on Microsoft Windows 9x/NT.

You will need the gc package (which is available from SlackBuilds.org),
to compile this.

NOTE: Don't bother trying to run w3m inside a screen session;
      it will segfault.
