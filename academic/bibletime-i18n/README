This is the alternative interface languages for the BibleTime sword frontend.

BibleTime is a Bible study application for Linux. It is based on the K Desktop
Environment  and uses the Sword  programming library to work with Bible texts,
commentaries, dictionaries and books provided by the Crosswire Bible Society.

Obviously this package is useless without the bibletime package.
