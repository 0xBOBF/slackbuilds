Poppler data helps poppler render CJK and Cyrillic fonts properly.
Note - this isn't necessarily necessary for poppler to function, but
may be a nice feature to install.  

Also note, this script was adopted from slackware's -current branch, and
all credit should go to Patrick Volkerding for his work.
