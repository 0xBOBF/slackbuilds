mpeg2dec - A test program for libmpeg2.

It decodes mpeg-1 and mpeg-2 video streams, and also includes a
demultiplexer for mpeg-1 and mpeg-2 program streams.
It is purposely kept simple : it does not
include features like reading files from a DVD, CSS, fullscreen
output, navigation, etc... The main purpose of mpeg2dec is to have a
simple test bed for libmpeg2.
The libmpeg2 source code is always distributed in the mpeg2dec
package, to make it easier for people to test it.
