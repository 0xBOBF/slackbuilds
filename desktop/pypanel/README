PyPanel is a lightweight panel/taskbar written in Python and C for X11 window
managers. It can be easily customized to match any desktop theme or taste. It
works with WindowMaker and EWMH-compliant WMs (Kahakai, Openbox, FVWM, PekWM,
etc).

Pypanel depends on python-xlib and imlib2, both available from slackbuilds.org
