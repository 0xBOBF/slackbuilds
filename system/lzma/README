The Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain-Algorithm (LZMA) provides very high 
compression ratio and fast decompression.
The core of the LZMA utils is Igor Pavlov's LZMA SDK containing
the actual LZMA encoder/decoder. LZMA utils add a few scripts
which provide gzip-like command line interface and a couple of
other LZMA related tools.
