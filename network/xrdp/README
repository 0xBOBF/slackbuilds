xrdp - Remote Desktop Server for Linux

Xrdp provides a fully functional Linux terminal server, capable of accepting 
connections from rdesktop and Microsoft's own terminal server/remote desktop 
clients. Xrdp uses Xvnc or X11rdp (which are installed separately) to manage
the X session.

Xvnc can be installed by installing tightvnc (available on SlackBuilds.org).
X11rdp can be compiled and installed by following the directions in the 
thread at http://tinyurl.com/2ufoz2 (link to LinuxQuestions.org).

By default, this script will make xrdp without PAM support since PAM is not 
installed in Slackware by default.  The script supports building with PAM,
but it is completely untested by us.  If you want to enable PAM, run the
script as follows:
	USE_PAM=yes ./xrdp.SlackBuild

After installing xrdp there are some configuration files in /etc/xrdp that 
can be modified.  sesman.ini has some useful options to take note of such as 
the ability to allow xrdp use by only a certain group and to specify the log 
location (by default the sesman log appears in the program directory so this 
should be changed).  xrdp.ini should be modified so that you have the options 
you want at the server login screen. For instance, if you want xrdp's default
options to be like those of a Windows RDP server then change xrdp.ini so that 
the (by default) given sesman-X11rdp set is option xrdp1.  
The man page for xrdp.ini has more details on the file.

/usr/lib/xrdp/startwm.sh by default loads KDE during a session.  Change this 
as desired to load a different DE/WM.  A similar script can be executed on a 
per-user basis.  See the sesman man page for more details.
