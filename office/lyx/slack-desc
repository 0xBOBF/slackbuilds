lyx: LyX is for people that write and want their writing to look great, right
lyx: out of the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting details, 'finger
lyx: painting' font attributes or futzing around with page boundaries. You just
lyx: write. In the background, Prof. Knuth's legendary TeX typesetting engine
lyx: makes you look good.
