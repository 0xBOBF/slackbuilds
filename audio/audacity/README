Audacity is free, open source software for recording and editing sounds.
With Audacity one can record live audio, convert tapes and records into
digital recordings, edit Ogg, MP3, and WAV sound files, and much more.

Audacity requires either wxPython or wxGTK, and optional dependencies 
are ffmpeg, soundtouch, and twolame.

soundtouch, twolame and ffmpeg support can be enabled in the build
script if installed. See the build script itself for more information.
