hibernate-script (frontend to TuxOnIce hibernation engine)

hibernate-script is a userspace frontend to the TuxOnIce code. It
interacts with a TuxOnIce-patched kernel providing the possibility to
put the computer into suspend-to ram (ACPI S3) or suspend-to-disk (ACPI S4)
state with a single console command.  Scriptlet API provides scalable
functionality to eliminate problems with some software. The user interface
part also can be tuned easily.

This package is recommended to run TuxOnIce-patched kernel.
