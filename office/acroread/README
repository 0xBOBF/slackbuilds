Adobe's Acrobat Reader application (official binary) repackaged
in "Slackware style" for easier system maintenance.

You will need to tell Acrobat Reader where to find the HTML rendering 
library; it's a simple process:
	Click on "Edit" --> "Preferences" -->  "Internet" Category
	In the box labeled "libgtkembedmoz Folder"  enter the following:
		/usr/lib/seamonkey
   
	Alternatively, create the following file:
		$HOME/.adobe/Acrobat/8.0/Preferences/acrogre.conf
	with the following contents:
		/usr/lib/seamonkey
