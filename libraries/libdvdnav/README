This is mplayer's fork of libdvdnav. libdvdnav is a library that allows easy 
use of sophisticated DVD navigation features such as DVD menus, multiangle 
playback, and even interactive DVD games.

libdvdnav does conflict with libdvdread, as a modified version of libdvdread 
is already included.  Most apps will work with this version too.
