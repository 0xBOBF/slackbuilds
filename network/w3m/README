w3m is a World Wide Web (WWW) text based client. It has English and
Japanese help files and an option menu and can be configured to use
either language. It will display hypertext markup language (HTML)
documents containing links to files residing on the local system, as
well as files residing on remote systems. It can display HTML tables,
frames, and images, and supports tabbed browsing. In addition, it can
be used as a "pager" in much the same manner as "more" or "less".
This buildscript includes some security and bug fix patches. However
the actual stable version of w3m is more than 3 years old. You should
not use it as your default browser, it is only here as an optional
dependency for SuperCollider.

This requires gc.
