cairomm is a C++ wrapper for the cairo graphics library. It offers
all the power of cairo with an interface familiar to C++ developers,
including use of the Standard Template Library where it makes sense.

This requires glibmm (also available from SlackBuilds.org).

If you want to build a newer version of cairomm, this script has been
tested and found to work properly with cairomm-1.2.2.  The only change
needed in the script is the VERSION string.  You will, however, have
to install the cairo-1.2.4 package from Slackware 11.0 /testing.
