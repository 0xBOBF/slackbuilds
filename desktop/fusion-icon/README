The Compiz Fusion Icon is a simple panel applet for starting and controlling 
Compiz Fusion. Upon launch, it will attempt to start Compiz Fusion 
automatically. You may need to select a window decorator if one does not 
appear.

In most cases, you can find Compiz Fusion under Applications -> System Tools -> 
Compiz Fusion Icon, or the equivalent in your desktop environment's menu. You 
can also run "fusion-icon &" from a console.

Fusion-icon is only available as a snapshot from git repo at this time, but
as a convenience, we offer a tarball on our server.
