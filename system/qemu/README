QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.

This is a binary release, repacked for Slackware's package management
system.

It seems the /usr/bin/qemu is hard-coded to look for some files in 
/usr/local/share - there are at least two ways to work around this
after the package is installed:
  1. cd /usr/local/share ; ln -s /usr/share/qemu qemu
  2. replace -s /usr/local/ /usr/./././ /usr/bin/qemu

The first method is the safest, but either should work relatively well.
