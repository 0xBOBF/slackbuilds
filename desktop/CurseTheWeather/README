CurseTheWeather is a python application which displays the weather in a 
terminal via a ncurses frontend (ctw).  This frontend shows ascii-art weather 
icons along with the current weather conditions and 10 day forecast.

weatherfeed.py is the python module that grabs the weather data from 
weather.com, and it can used by frontends other than ctw.


** ctw and Transparency, Different Colors **

If you are interested in changing the colors in ctw, or if you use 
transparency in your terminals and would like this to work with ctw, then 
simply modify initColors() in /usr/bin/ctw.  For transparency, simply add:

curses.use_default_colors()

at line 125 (just under "curses.start_color()").
Modifying the lines with "curses.init_pair" will allow you to modify the text 
colors used.
