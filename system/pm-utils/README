The pm-utils package provides simple shell command line tools
to suspend and hibernate computers that can be used to run 
vendor or distro supplied scripts on suspend and resume.

See the installed documentation, especially README.SLACKWARE,
for usage hints and such.

vbetool and radeontool are not required, but you should probably
install them just in case your hardware needs them.
