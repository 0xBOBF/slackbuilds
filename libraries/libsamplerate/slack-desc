libsamplerate: libsamplerate (Sample Rate Converter for audio)
libsamplerate:
libsamplerate: Secret Rabbit Code (aka libsamplerate) is a Sample Rate Converter
libsamplerate: for audio. One example of where such a thing would be useful is
libsamplerate: converting audio from the CD sample rate of 44.1kHz to the 48kHz
libsamplerate: sample rate used by DAT players. SRC is capable of arbitrary 
libsamplerate: and time varying conversions. SRC provides a small set of 
libsamplerate: converters to allow quality to be traded off against 
libsamplerate: computation cost.
