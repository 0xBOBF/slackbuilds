Gtk#, a GUI Toolkit, is a set of .NET bindings for the gtk+ toolkit
and assorted GNOME (http://www.gnome.org/) libraries. This library
allows you to build fully native graphical Gnome applications using
Mono. GTK# is an event-driven system like any other modern windowing
library.

Requires Mono, available at SlackBuilds.org
