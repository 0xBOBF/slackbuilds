Long Range ZIP or Lzma RZIP

This is a compression program optimised for large files. The larger the file
and the more memory you have, the better the compression advantage this will
provide, especially once the files are larger than 100MB. The advantage can
be chosen to be either size (much smaller than bzip2) or speed (much faster
than bzip2).

The major disadvantages are:
1. The main lrzip application only works on single files so it requires the
   lrztar wrapper to fake a complete archiver.
2. It requires a lot of memory to get the best performance out of, and is not
   really usable (for compression) with less than 256MB. Decompression requires
   less ram and works on smaller ram machines.
3. Only stdin in compression works well. The other combinations of
   stdin/stdout work but in a very inefficient manner generating temporary
   files on disk so this method of using lrzip is not recommended.
4. Files compressed on a 64 bit OS with a compression window greater than 20
   (2 GB) may not decompress on a 32 bit OS.

See the file README.benchmarks for performance examples and what kind of data
lrzip is very good with.

NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE WARNING
All files created with lrzip 0.50+ are not backward compatible with versions
prior to 0.50. v0.50 can read earlier generated files.
