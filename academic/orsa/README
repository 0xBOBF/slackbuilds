ORSA (Orbit Reconstruction, Simulation and Analysis)

ORSA is an interactive tool for scientific grade Celestial Mechanics 
computations.  Asteroids, comets, artificial satellites, Solar and 
extra-Solar planetary systems can be accurately reproduced, simulated, 
and analyzed.  This does not support Close approaches tool.
 
This requires gsl, cln, ginac, and openmpi.
