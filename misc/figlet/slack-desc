# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

figlet: FIGlet prints its input using  large  characters made up of ordinary  
figlet: screen characters. FIGlet output is generally reminiscent of the sort 
figlet: of signatures many people like to put at the end of e-mail and Usenet 
figlet: messages.
figlet: It is also reminiscent of the output of some  banner  programs, 
figlet: although it is oriented normally, not sideways.
