MyBashBurn (Burn from the CLI with dialog boxes)

A frontend with dialog box that draws (using ncurses) windows onto 
the screen and can burn data cds, music cds, supports burning 
DVD-images and data DVDs as well as ripping/encoding.

It was forked form bashburn to provide a nicer User Interface.

If you want MyBashBurn to handle mp3 files, please install LAME,
which is also available at SlackBuilds.org.
