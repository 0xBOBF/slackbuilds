ftjam: ftjam (make like program construction tool)
ftjam: 
ftjam: Jam recursively builds target files from source files, using
ftjam: dependency information and updating actions expressed in the Jambase
ftjam: file, which is written in jam's own interpreted language.  The default
ftjam: Jambase is compiled into jam and provides a boilerplate for common
ftjam: use, relying on a user-provide file "Jamfile" to enumerate actual
ftjam: targets and sources.
