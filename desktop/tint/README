tint is a simple panel/taskbar intentionally made for openbox3, but should
also work with other window managers. It's based off ttm code.

The goal is to keep a clean and unintrusive look with code lightweight and
compliance with freedesktop specifications.

imlib2 is required (it is also available at SlackBuilds.org).

On the first run, /etc/xdg/tint/tintrc is copied to ~/.config/tint/tintrc.
This is used as the configuration. 3 other samples are included in
/usr/doc/tint-*/tintrc-samples that may also be used; you can edit 
~/.config/tint/tintrc to your preference.
