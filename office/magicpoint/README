Magic Point is an X11-based presentation tool.  It allows you to
quickly create nice-looking presentations.  The presentation file
format is plain text so you can use a text editor of your own
preference.

NOTE: /usr/X11R6/bin/xmkmf must be in your $PATH when you run this
      script.  The easiest way to ensure this is to either use "su -"
      instead of "su" or "source /etc/profile" after "su"
