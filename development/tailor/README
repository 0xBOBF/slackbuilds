Tailor (A VCS/DVCS repository conversion tool) 

Tailor is a tool to migrate changesets between Aegis, ArX, Bazaar, Bazaar-NG,
CVS, Codeville, Darcs, Git, Mercurial, Monotone, Perforce, Subversion and Tla
repositories.

You will need to install the VCS/DVCS tools separately; Tailor will use them
to convert your repositories.
