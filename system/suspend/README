This package contains some userland tools allowing you to suspend a Linux
system either to disk or to RAM.  These tools provide some capabilities
that are not available in the vanilla Linux kernel.

This requires quite a bit of configuration after installation;
be sure to read the documentation in /usr/doc/suspend-0.8/.
