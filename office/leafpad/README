Leafpad is a simple GTK+ text editor that emphasizes simplicity. As development 
focuses on keeping weight down to a minimum, only the most essential features 
are implemented in the editor. Leafpad is simple to use, is easily compiled, 
requires few libraries, and starts up quickly.

NOTE: leafpad has optional dependencies of libgnomeprint & libgnomeprintui,
both of which are available on SlackBuilds.org.
