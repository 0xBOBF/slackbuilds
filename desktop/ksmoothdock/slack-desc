# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

ksmoothdock:
ksmoothdock: ksmoothdock is a cool desktop panel (like KDE's kicker) for KDE 3.2
ksmoothdock: and above with smooth zooming (2 modes: normal and parabolic). Its
ksmoothdock: aim is to provide a cool alternative/complement to kicker. As it is
ksmoothdock: intended for KDE/Linux, its behaviour will be like that of kicker.
