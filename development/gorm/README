As part of the GNUstep project, Gorm is meant to be the counterpart to 
NeXT's Interface Builder. With Gorm designing tough and complex graphical 
interfaces for your applications can easily and quickly be done using drag 
and drop, powerful inspectors and teamwork with ProjectCenter.

This requires gnustep-make, gnustep-base, gnustep-gui, and gnustep-back.
