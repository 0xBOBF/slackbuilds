Graveman is a GTK2 front end to cdrecord, mkisofs, readcd, sox,
flac, dvd+rw-tools, and cdrdao.  Graveman can burn audio cds
from ogg, mp3, and flac, and can burn data cds and dvds, copy  
on the fly, clean rewritable cds and dvds, and duplicate cds.

This SlackBuild assumes one has installed the following packages from
the standard Slackware installation CD's:  gtk+, glib, libglade, 
libid3tag, libmad, libogg, libvorbis, cdrtools, dvd+rw-tools, sox,
libflac, cdrdao, and libmng.
