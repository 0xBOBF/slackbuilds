Prism is a simple XULRunner-based browser that hosts web applications without
the normal web browser user interface. Prism is based on a concept called
Site-Specific Browsers (SSB). An SSB is designed to work exclusively with a
single web application. It doesn't have the menus, toolbars and other
accoutrements of a traditional web browser. An SSB also offers tighter
integration with the operating system and desktop than a typical web
application running through a web browser. Applications running in an SSB are
therefore able to benefit from many of the advantages of the desktop and of
the web at the same time.

Benefits:
 * separate proecesses
 * minimal user interface
 * basic desktop integration
 * customization

This is a repackaged version of the official Mozilla Prism tarball.
