Google's Picasa Image Suite

Picasa is software that helps you instantly find, edit and share all 
the pictures on your PC. Every time you open Picasa, it automatically 
locates all your pictures (even ones you forgot you had) and sorts 
them into visual albums organized by date with folder names you will 
recognize. Picasa also makes advanced editing simple by putting one
click fixes and powerful effects at your fingertips.
