PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management
system (ORDBMS) based on POSTGRES. With more than 15 years of
development history, it is quickly becoming the de facto
database for enterprise level open source solutions.

This script builds postgresql with a couple of useful features in the
contrib directory.

adminpack -
        File and log manipulation routines, used by pgAdmin
        by Dave Page <dpage@vale-housing.co.uk>

tsearch2 -
        Full-text-index support using GiST
        by Teodor Sigaev <teodor@sigaev.ru> and Oleg Bartunov
        <oleg@sai.msu.su>.


Before you can run postgresql you'll need to create the
database files in /var/lib/pgsql. The following should do
the trick.

  # su postgres -c "initdb -D /var/lib/pgsql/data"

Additionally, a logrotation script is added to /etc/logrotate.d/ and an
rc.postgresql script is added.  In order to activate postgresql at boot
time and shut it down properly upon system shutdown, add the following
lines to the following files.

  /etc/rc.d/rc.local
  ==================

  # Startup postgresql
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.postgresql ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.postgresql start
  fi


  /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown
  ===========================

  # Stop postgres
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.postgresql ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.postgresql stop
  fi

Additionally, you'll have to set the rc script to be executable just
like any other Slackware rc script.

  # chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.postgresql
