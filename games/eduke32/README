EDuke32 is a fork of the JFDuke3D port of Duke Nukem 3D (aka Duke3D),
merging it with EDuke to provide many new features for mod authors.
Also included is a map editor (mapster32).

To play the game, you will need the DUKE32.GRP file from either the
Duke Nukem 3D CD-ROM, or from the shareware version of Duke Nukem 3D.

To play the game, you must provide the data files.
For convenience, the shareware GRP file has been packaged as
eduke32_shareware_data, also available from slackbuilds.org.
See README_game_data.txt

If you want to play the HRP (High Resolution Pack), get the
eduke32_hires_pack package from slackbuilds.org
