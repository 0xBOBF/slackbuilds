D-Bus is a message bus system - a simple way for applications to talk
to one another.

D-Bus supplies both a system daemon (for events such as "new hardware
device added" or "printer queue changed") and a per-user-login-session
daemon (for general IPC needs among user applications). Also, the message
bus is built on top of a general one-to-one message passing framework,
which can be used by any two apps to communicate directly (without going
through the message bus daemon). Currently the communicating applications
are on one computer, but TCP/IP option is available and remote support
planned. 

You will need to create the 'messagebus' user and group before installing the
dbus package; sample lines to do so are below:
  /usr/sbin/groupadd -g 81 messagebus
  /usr/sbin/useradd -c 'System Message Bus' -g messagebus -u 81 -d '/' \
    -s /bin/false messagebus
Note that the "\" character is a escape character, meaning that both of those
lines are actually *one* line.  Also note that the numerical uid and gid given
in the above sample lines may need to change on your system; if you already
have an existing user and/or group with those id's, then they obviously need
to be modified for your system.  Because the 'messagebus' user and group are
considered system accounts, the custom is to make their uid's and gid's less
than 100, but that's entirely up to you.  Note that Slackware 12.0 will use
uid and gid of 81 for these groups, so you should strongly consider using them
instead of changing them.

After creating the 'messagebus' user and group, you will need to make sure
the /etc/rc.d/rc.messagebus script is run at boot.  The easiest way to do this
is adding something like the following line to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.messagebus ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.messagebus start
  fi

You will also want to stop the messagebus service at shutdown; the easiest way
to do this is adding something like the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown:
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.messagebus ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.messagebus stop
  fi
