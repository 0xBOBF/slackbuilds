CenterIM is a multi-protocol command-line instant messenger.
It supports most major protocols such as MSN, ICQ, Yahoo and Jabber.

CenterIM was forked from the CenterICQ project, and includes many patches
previously submitted, including the hefty patch to resolve seg faults when
connecting to MSN.

CenterIM requires gpgme (which requies libgpg-error). SlackBuilds for both 
are available at slackbuilds.org
