Sphinx (Documentation generator)

Sphinx is a tool that translates a set of reStructuredText source
files into various output formats, automatically producing
cross-references, indices etc.  The focus is on hand-written
documentation, rather than auto-generated API docs.  Though there is
support for that kind of docs as well (which is intended to be
freely mixed with hand-written content).  If you need pure API docs
have a look at Epydoc, which also understands reST.

This requires pysetuptools, docutils, and Jinja2.

Jinja2 circular dependencies warning:

The DOCS=yes flag needs Sphinx to build python docs, it and needs Jinja2
but that needs Sphinx because you have set its DOCS=yes flag.
If you really need the docs build Jinja2 without the DOCS=yes flag
build Sphinx then rebuild Jinja2 with DOCS=yes.

Incidentally, unless you are a developer, you don't normally need the
DOCS=yes flag.

Optionally, Pygments can be used at runtime, if installed.
