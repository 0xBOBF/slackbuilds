Exim is a mail transfer agent (MTA) used on Unix-like operating systems. 
It is freely available under the GNU GPL and it aims to be a general 
and flexible mailer with extensive facilities for checking incoming e-mail.

Exim was orginally written by Philip Hazel for use in the University 
of Cambridge Computing Services e-mail systems. 

Exim has no configure but requires the exim.Makefile. This file is included
with the makefile. The exim.Makefile has some of the more important attributes
enabled such as Content scanning, Database integration ((only Mysql), extra 
security facilities (such as TCPWRAPPERS) and more.  

Also "eximon" (the configuration for this is eximon.Makefile) and  has been 
included which a nice and simple monitoring tool for X and hence can be used 
from any console to monitor your MTA. Please read through both files 
and mofidy them as you see fit.

All documentation for exim is included in /usr/doc/exim-*. Another good 
source for documentation can be found at http://www.exim-new-users.co.uk/.

To fully integrate Exim with the rest of your system you would have to create 
symlinks for sendmail to point to the exim binary. Please *NOTE* that this 
might break sendmail from working. If you ever remove exim, you might need to
reinstall Sendmail.

Finally Exim can be integrated with other email tools such as Clamav,
Spamassassin, Bogofilter and others, which are available at Slackbuilds.org.
