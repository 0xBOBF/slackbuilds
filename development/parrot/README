        Parrot VM - a VM for dynamic languages

Parrot is a virtual machine designed to efficiently compile and  
execute bytecode for dynamic languages. Parrot currently hosts
a variety of dynamic languages such as Tcl, Javascript, Ruby, 
Lua, Scheme, PHP, Python, Perl 6, APL, and a .NET bytecode translator.

If you want to compile parrot with icu4c run the SlackBuild as below. 
You'll need of course to install icu4c. A build script for this is available
at SlackBuilds.org.

ICU=yes ./parrot.SlackBuild
