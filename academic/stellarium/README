Stellarium shows a realistic sky in 3D, just like what you see with the
naked eye, binoculars or a telescope.  It is being used in planetarium
projectors. Just set your coordinates and go.

For reasonable performance, you will want to have some kind of 3D
acceleration.

Starting from version 0.9.1, stellarium REQUIRES qt4 be installed. The
build system has gone through a bit of changes too cmake is now used
instead of the configure script.  Cmake will search for qmake and other qt4
executables so, if they're not already present inside the PATH variable,
you will have to tell cmake where it can find it, using the QT4PATH variable
inside the script.

Requiers: qt4 and boost both of which you can find at slackbuilds.org
