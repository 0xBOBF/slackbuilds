GRUB4DOS is a universal boot loader based on GNU GRUB, with bugfixes 
and new features such as built-in BIOS disk emulation, ATAPI CDROM
driver, and Chinese support. It can be loaded from DOS/LINUX,
via Windows boot manager/syslinux/lilo, or from MBR/CD.

To build the Chinese version, run the script like this:
CHINESE="yes" ./grub4dos.SlackBuild

To chainload Grub4dos from LILO, copy /usr/share/grub4dos/grub.exe to
your /boot folder and add the following to your lilo.conf:
image = /boot/grub.exe
  label = Grub4dos

It can be useful as a back up boot loader if you, for example, forget to
run 'lilo' after a kernel update.

This package does not conflict with the Grub package in /extra.
It is safe to have both installed.

Note: this will not build on x86_64.
