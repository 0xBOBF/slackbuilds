Icon-naming-utils generate icon files for your desktop environment

It is a script for maintaining backwards compatibility with current desktop 
icon themes while migrating to the names specified in the freedesktop.org
Icon Naming Specification.  For more information, see:
http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-latest.html

Icon-naming-utils needs the XML::Simple perl module, which is available at
