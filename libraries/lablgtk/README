LablGTK is an Objective Caml interface to gtk+/gtk+-2

It uses the rich type system of Objective Caml 3 to provide a strongly typed, 
yet very comfortable, object-oriented interface to gtk+. This is not that easy 
if you know the dynamic typing approach taken by gtk+.

It is still under development, but already fully functional. All widgets (but 
one) are available, with almost all their methods. The GLArea widget is also 
supported in combination with LablGL. LibGlade and GdkPixbuf support is also 
included for both versions. LablGTK2 adds support for gnomecanvas, librsvg and 
libpanel Many examples are provided.

Objective Caml threads are supported, including for the toplevel, which allows 
for interactive use of the library.  Since release 1.2.1, LablGTK contains 
support for rapid development with glade, through an interface wrapper compiler, 
and a libglade binding. You can also find code generators in the tools section. 

You need an ocaml compiler (available on http://slackbuilds.org) to use and/or 
to compile.
