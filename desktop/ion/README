Ion is a tiling (no overlapping windows) window manager that also has
PWM-style tabbed frames which can contain multiple client windows. These
features help to keep windows organized and to switch quickly between them.
Ion was designed primarily as an efficient and unobtrusive window manager 
for users who prefer the keyboard. 

This is the latest stable release of Ion (3). A pwm3 binary is built
too, which starts Ion with floating workspaces as the default, thus replacing
the PWM window manager.

ion-3 needs lua, which is also available from SlackBuilds.org. If you have 
installed lua on your own, the binary might be stored under /usr/local/bin 
or any other destination you have specified.
However, if lua is not located under /usr/bin, either change the LUABINDIR 
variable in the SlackBuild script or run the SlackBuild script with 
the following command:
	LUABINDIR="PATH_TO_BIN_DIRECTORY" ./ion.SlackBuild
