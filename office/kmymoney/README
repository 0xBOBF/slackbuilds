KmyMoney is a simple financial accounting manager for KDE for personal or
small-business use. It is a full double-entry accounting software package.

IF you want to enable support for ofxbanking, you need to have libofx
installed (a build script for this is available at SlackBuilds.org). The 
configure process will detect and enable it.
