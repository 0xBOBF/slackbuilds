Clearsilver is a fast, powerful, and language-neutral template system meant
primarily for html.

In both static content sites and dynamic HTML applications, it provides a
separation between presentation code and application logic which makes working
with your project easier.

clearsilver.Slackbuild requires that PERL and Python be installed.

Beware running this slackbuild with an MAKEFLAGS=-jn flags.  The clearsilver
build system skipped building the perl portion of the package when I tried
MAKEFLAGS=-j2.
