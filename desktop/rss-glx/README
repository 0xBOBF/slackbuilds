The Really Slick ScreenSavers GLX Port is a port of some nifty OpenGL
screensavers that were originally written for Windows to GLX. It is
intended for use with an existing screensaver daemon like xscreensaver.

Optional Requirements:
 OpenAL for sound (skyrocket)
 GLEW for vertical refresh (all) and shaders (hyperspace).

GLEW is highly recommended as it reduces CPU usage and prevents
visual tearing.

Both are available at SlackBuilds.org
