MythTV is a GPL licensed suite of programs that allow you to build the 
mythical home media convergence box on your own using Open Source software 
and operating systems. MythTV is known to work on Linux and Mac OS X 
(PowerPC and Intel).

You need to create a database before you can run mythtv:
> mysql -u root -p  < /usr/share/mythtv/database/mc.sql

Then run mythtv-setup to configure mythtv
> mythtv-setup

Detailed instructions for mythtv can be found here:
 http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/User_Manual:Initial_Installation

Mythtv requires lame, and optionally can use xmltv (to create the program 
listings if you live outside of North America) and lirc (for IR remote control)
