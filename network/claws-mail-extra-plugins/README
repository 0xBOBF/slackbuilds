                attachments.

* clamd: Scans messages using clamd (Clam AV).
* fancy: Renders html email using the GTK+ port of WebKit library.
* fetchinfo: Insets headers containing download info into emails.
* geolocation_plugin: Display a map showing the location of the sender.
* gtkhtml2_viewer: Renders HTML emails using the gtkhtml2 widget.
* mailmbox: Handles mbox format mailboxes.
* newmail: Writes email header summary to a log file.
* notification_plugin: Provides various ways to notify the user of new and
                       unread mail.

* rssyl: Allows you to read RSS newsfeeds.
* spam_report: Reports spam to various places.
* tnef_parse: Enables reading application/ms-tnef attachments.

Requirements:
  The fancy plugin requires webkit.
  The geolocation plugin requires libchamplain.

Note: By default the package will include every plugin; this can be changed
very easily in the script - it uses a list of plugins to be built, and plugins
can be added or removed easily enough.

Note: The geolocation plugin is disabled until libchamplain builds.
