The Structured Terminal Forms Language/Library

STFL is a library which implements a curses-based widget set for text
terminals. The STFL API can be used from C, SPL, Python, Perl and
Ruby. The public STFL API is only 14 simple function calls big and and
there are already generic SWIG bindings. Thus it is very easy to port
to additional scripting languages.

This package should build with no special effort on a stock Slackware
installation. However, none of the scripting language bindings are enabled -
for that, you'll need SWIG and the language of interest.
