baghira - A native theme/style for KDE 3.2+

Baghira is a style package for KDE 3.2+ that resembles nearly 
the entire Mac OS X user interface in detail. When the correct 
settings are made, and the right tools are used, the KDE desktop 
can look like a real Mac OS X desktop.

The name refers to the Panther of Kipling's famous Jungle Book 
(German spelling). You will probably rather know the Disney 
version... ;)

Basically it's a perky imitation of Apple's OSX look
