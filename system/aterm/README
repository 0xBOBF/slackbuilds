aterm is designed to provide pleasing visual effects, while
performing such a mundane function as terminal emulation under X. It is
largely based on rxvt code. Several points set it apart from other
similar applications:
* fast pseudo-transparency, that does not consume any additional resources.
* optional off-focus fading of text - when aterm looses focus its contents is dimmed.
* NeXT-ish scrollbar
