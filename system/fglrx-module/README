fglrx-module (The module of kernel for the ATI proprietary driver)

This package includes only the kernel module required by the 
ATI proprietary driver.

You need also the package for X server (fglrx-driver) to complete
the installation. You can find a SlackBuild for it at SlackBuilds.org.

Add the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.modules or an equivalent file:
	# Load fglrx modules
	modprobe fglrx

You must rebuild this package each time you update your kernel

Also, if you upgrade this package(and fglrx-driver) remember to unload
the fglrx module(# modprobe -r fglrx) and load it again(# modprobe fglrx).
