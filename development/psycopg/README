psycopg is a PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming 
language (just like pygresql and popy.) It was written from scratch 
with the aim of being very small and fast, and stable as a rock. 
The main advantages of psycopg are that it supports (well, will support) 
the full Python DBAPI-2.0 and being thread safe at level 2.

This requires postgresql and egenix-mx-base, both of which are 
available at SlackBuilds.org.
