QtOctave is a graphical user interface for gnu octave, which is an 
open source program alternative to Matlab.

QtOctave requires Octave and Qt4, both available on SlackBuilds.org.

If you build on a multicore system, add JOBS={#} to enable parallel 
compilation, as in:   JOBS=4 ./qtoctave.SlackBuild
