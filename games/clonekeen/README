CloneKeen is an open-source clone of ID's classic DOS game Commander
Keen. CloneKeen runs under many platforms including Linux & win32. There
are some improvements over the original such as 2-player support. Original
game data files are required.

clonekeen is able to run Commander Keen episodes 1, 2, and 3. Episodes
4 through 6 are not yet supported. Copy the *.ck1, *.ck2, and/or *.ck3
files from the game installation directory to /usr/share/games/clonekeen

Optionally, the package can include the shareware (episode 1) game data
files.

You must install libdynamite (available from SBo), since it's required
to extract the game data. After running the SlackBuild script, the
resulting package can be installed on a system without libdynamite
(it's only required at build time). The extractor may also be useful
for extracting the .SHR files from uninstalled copies of the commercial
Commander Keen games (not tested by author).
