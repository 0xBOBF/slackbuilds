Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid 
development and clean, pragmatic design.  It includes a template
engine, and an object-relational mapper.

This SlackBuild requires the pysetuptools package to compile; a
SlackBuild for this package is available from SlackBuilds.org.

Although Django can be used without database functionality, it is
especially useful with database support.  Various databases are
supported through Python database bindings.  For example, sqlite3
databases are supported when the pysqlite2 package is installed.
Due to the dynamic nature of Python software, database bindings
are not required when Django is built and can be installed later.
