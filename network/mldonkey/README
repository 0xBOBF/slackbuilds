MLDonkey is an open source, free software multi-network peer-to-peer
application. 

MLDonkey requires "ocaml" to build and also requires "lablgtk2" if you 
want to enable its GUI.  It will try to download lablgtk2 and ocaml from
the web and build it locally if they are not found on your system, so 
you'll want to have them installed already.

By default, this SlackBuild is going to build MLdonkey without its GUI. 
If you want to enable MLDonkey's GUI, you'll have to enable it with the 
GUIOPT variable like this:   GUIOPT=yes ./mldonkey.SlackBuild

Without a GUI, you can control mldonkey via connecting to localhost:4080
with your web browser.
