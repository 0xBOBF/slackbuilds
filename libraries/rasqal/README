Rasqal is a library providing full support for querying Resource
Description Framework (RDF) including parsing query syntaxes,
constructing the queries, executing them and returning result formats.
It currently handles the RDF Data Query Language (RDQL) and SPARQL
Query language.

This depends on raptor (also available at SlackBuilds.org).
