recoll (personal full text search tool)

Recoll is a personal full text search tool for Unix/Linux.
It is based on the very strong Xapian backend, for which it 
provides an easy to use, feature-rich, easy administration, 
QT graphical interface.

The homepage of recoll is found at http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/

recoll depends on some other packages, that are not met by a
standard Slackware install. All these should be covered by seperate
build scripts. These dependencies are:

Required:
  xapian-core (http://www.xapian.org/)
Optional:
  antiword    (http://www.winfield.demon.nl/)
  unrtf       (http://www.gnu.org/software/unrtf/unrtf.html)

NOTE: As of the time of writing, recoll depends on version 0.9.10 of
xapian-core, the newer 1.0.0 release does NOT work with this version 
of recoll.
Else no incompatibilities are known.

After installing the package you should create the file 
$HOME/.recoll/recoll.conf and modify it to your needs, especially the 
"topdirs" where recoll looks for files to index. See "man recoll.conf" 
for details.
