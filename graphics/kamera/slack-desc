# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

kamera: kamera (digital camera kio_slave)
kamera:
kamera: Kamera lets you browse your camera from within konqueror in kde
kamera: (URL: camera:/) and is configured via the control center. This is
kamera: actually part of kdegraphics, but since it requires libgphoto2 to
kamera: compile, it's not part of the stock kdegraphics package; note that
kamera: this kamera package will NOT conflict with stock kdegraphics.
