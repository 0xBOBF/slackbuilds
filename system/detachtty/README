detachtty lets you run interactive programs non-interactively, and
connect to them over the network when you do need to interact with
them. It's designed for long-running Lisp processes. Unlike screen,
it works in emacs comint modes, and unlike qcmu, it deals correctly
with passing on a SIGINT sent to it. Needs ssh for operation over
the net.
