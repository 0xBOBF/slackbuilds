Abe is a scrolling, platform-jumping, key-collecting, ancient pyramid exploring game,
vaguely in the style of similar games for the Commodore+4.  The game is intended
to show young people all the cool games they missed.

Abe depends on SDL and SDL_mixer.  All dependancies are included in the Slackware
12.2 SDL package.
