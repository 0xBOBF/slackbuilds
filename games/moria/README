Moria/UMoria - a roguelike game.

A single player roguelike game with a regenerating dungeon, moria is the 
predecessor of angband with a full-screen, text-based, turn-based interface. 
It features scrolling maps, and an infinite (constantly regenerated) dungeon. 

Moria's dungeons are populated by monsters, some of which are inspired by 
J.R.R. Tolkien's books. The goal of the game is to find and kill the Balrog, 
whereupon the player is crowned King. Your player can be created from a 
combination of 8 races (human, half-elf, elf, halfling, gnome, dwarf, half-orc,
half-troll) and 6 classes (warrior, mage, priest, rogue, ranger, paladin), 
and is measured by 6 attributes (strength, dexterity, intelligence, wisdom, 
constitution, and charisma).

NOTE: despite the package name, this is actually UMORIA 5.5.2. 
      Also, this is a repackaging of Debian's binary, as the original source
      seems to be impossible to find.
