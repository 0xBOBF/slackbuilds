Htscanner allows one to use htaccess-like files to configure PHP
on a per-directory basis, just like Apache's htaccess. It is
especially useful with fastcgi.

Please read the "Description" part of /usr/doc/htscanner-1.15/README
after installation. An example /etc/php/htscanner.ini is included.

A configuration example, maybe something like the following:

cat << EOF > /var/www/htdocs/.htaccess 
<IfModule mod_php.c>
        php_value register_globals On
</IfModule>
EOF

sh /etc/rc.d/rc.httpd stop
sh /etc/rc.d/rc.httpd start

To test, try:

php -i | grep htscanner
