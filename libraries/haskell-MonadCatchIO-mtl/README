haskell-MonadCatchIO-mtl (Monad-transformer version of haskell-mtl)

Provides a monad-transformer version of the Control.Exception.catch
function.  For this, it defines the MonadCatchIO class, a subset of
MonadIO.  It defines proper instances for most monad transformers in
the mtl library.

This requires haskell-mtl.
