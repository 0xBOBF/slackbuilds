rtl-wifi driver SVN release

This script is tested using the svn code from 20080522 and a patch to make it work with the 2.6.24 kernel.

This package provides support to Realtek Wifi cards based on rtl8180 chipsets.

It will compile and install the following modules:
  ieee80211_crypt-rtl
  ieee80211_crypt_wep-rtl
  ieee80211_crypt_tkip-rtl
  ieee80211_crypt_ccmp-rtl
  ieee80211-rtl
  r8180

The rtl-wifi installation instructions indicate that you must remove the 
stock kernel's ieee80211 and mac80211 modules prior to installing
this package.  While this is not something we prefer to do, if you need
this package, you might feel differently.  The instructions suggest the
following:
  rm -rf /lib/modules/<kernel_version>/kernel/net/ieee80211
  rm -rf /lib/modules/<kernel_version>/kernel/net/mac80211
We recommend that you move these two directories elsewhere instead so that
you can easily restore them in the event that you no longer need the
rtl-wifi package.  Be sure to run "depmod -a" after adding or removing
kernel modules.
