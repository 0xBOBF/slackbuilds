comix (image viewer that supports viewing images in archives)

comix can display images in archives or directories, removing the need to 
decompress comicbook files.  It supports zip, rar, or tar (gzip or bzip2) 
archives.  It is written in Python and uses GTK+ through the PyGTK bindings.

This requires unrar.
