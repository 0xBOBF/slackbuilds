3D-Desktop is an OpenGL program for switching virtual desktops in 
a seamless 3-dimensional manner on Linux. The current desktop is 
mapped into a fullscreen 3D environment where you may choose other 
screens. Several different visualization modes are available.

Although Slackware 12.0 comes with imlib, 3ddesktop requires imlib2,
which is available on SlackBuilds.org.
