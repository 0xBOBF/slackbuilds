GCC-XML is the XML output extension to GCC.  The purpose of the GCC-XML
extension is to generate an XML description of a C++ program from GCC's
internal representation.  Since XML is easy to parse, other development
tools will be able to work with C++ programs without the burden of a
complicated C++ parser.

GCC-XML project is not making formal releases since version 0.6.0,
published back in February 2004; "lack of time" is cited as the reason
on GCC-XML Web site.  Thus, we're using CVS snapshot created for current
version of corresponding Debian package, and hosted on Debian site;
thanks to Debian guys for kindly allowing access to this resource.
