BTPD is a bittorrent  client consisting of a daemon and
client commands, which can be used to read and/or 
manipulate the daemon state. The daemon is capable of 
running several torrents simultaneously and only uses one
tcp port. It's fairly low on resource usage and should be 
perfect for file distribution sites. Efficient downloads and
ease of use makes this client a good choice for the casual 
user as well.

Features:
* Runs multiple torrents simultaneously;
* Only uses one tcp port;
* Command line interface;
* Runs as a daemon; no need for constant gui or terminal;
* Bandwidth rate limiting for out- and inbound traffic;
* Supports the multitracker extension;
* Supports the key tracker extension.
