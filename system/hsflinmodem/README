Last free Linuxant hsflinmodem drivers

Linuxant is a company that provides software drivers for conexant
modems and chipsets to run on linux machines.  These types of
modems are commonly known as 'winmodems' as their software is
designed for use on Microsoft Windows.  Linuxant at one time
provided the software for free but recently they have been
charging money for the drivers.  They still provide a 'free' set
of drivers that limit the modem speed to 14.4Kbps.

The last "free" (as in beer) drivers come with a license that prohibits
distribution of versions marked "beta" or "lnxtbeta".  Therefore it may be
difficult to find the source files.  You may want to keep the source package
around in case the files become unavailable.

These drivers will most likely not work with a 2.6.x kernel.

Run "hsfconfig" after installing this package to setup the modem.
This will build some kernel modules and change a few other files.

Unfortunately, this script does not do a great job of cleaning up after itself.
To completely remove the drivers, you must do the following:
  1.  Run "hsfconfig --remove" to have the script remove the kernel modules.
  2.  Remove the package.
  3.  Remove the /etc/hsf directory.
  4.  Replace /dev/modem with /dev/modem.old
