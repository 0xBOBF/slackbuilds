KMyFirewall attempts to make it easier to setup IPTables based firewalls on 
Linux systems. It will be the right tool if you like to have a so called 
"Personal Firewall" running on your Linux box, but don't have the time and/or
the interest to spend hours in front of the IPTables manual just to setup a 
firewall that keeps the "bad" people out.

The firewall has the ability to save entire rulesets, so you only have to 
configure your ruleset one time, and then you can use it on several computers
 giving each of them a similar configuration (p.e. school networks, office, 
university, etc.).

Programs can't do any magic, so you still will have to know what your firewall
should do to setup your ruleset. KMyFirewall just tries to help you as much as
possible, but you decide what it will do.

Since the last stable release, the user interface has been expanded to enable 
easier and more flexible configuration for both advanced and novice users. 
Also, NAT support has become far more accessible to setup.
