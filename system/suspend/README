This package contains some userland tools allowing you to suspend a Linux
system either to disk or to RAM.  These tools provide some capabilities
that are not available in the vanilla Linux kernel.

This requires libx86, which is also available from SlackBuilds.org.

This also requires quite a bit of configuration after installation;
be sure to read the documentation in /usr/doc/suspend-0.8/.
