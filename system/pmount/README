mount removable devices as normal user

pmount is a wrapper around the standard mount program which permits normal
users to mount removable devices without a matching /etc/fstab entry. This
provides a robust basis for automounting frameworks like GNOME's Utopia
project and confines the amount of code that runs as root to a minimum.

This package also contains a wrapper "pmount-hal" which reads some
information like device labels and mount options from hal and passes them
to pmount. Install the package "hal" if you want to use this feature.

If a LUKS capable cryptsetup package is installed, pmount is able to
transparently mount encrypted volumes.

This requires ivman and HAL, both of which are available at SlackBuilds.org.

The user executing 'pmount' probably via 'ivman-launch' must be a member 
of the 'plugdev' system group (which is required by HAL).
