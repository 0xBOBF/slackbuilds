Mono Debugger support for MonoDevelop.

The Mono Soft Debugger is a new debugging framework for Mono. Unlike regular 
debuggers which act as all-knowing and controlling programs that control a 
separate process, the Mono Soft Debugger is actually a cooperative debugger 
that is built into the Mono runtime.

Applications communicate with the Mono runtime and request debugging 
operations to be performed on the target process.

The Mono Soft Debugger first became available with Mono 2.6 and is primarily 
used today with Mono on the iPhone (http://monotouch.net) and is used from 
the MonoDevelop IDE (http://monodevelop.com). 

This requires monodevelop and mono-debugger.
