The editor 'ee' (easy editor) is intended to be a simple, easy to use
terminal-based screen oriented editor that requires no instruction to use.
It's primary use would be for people who are new to computers, or who use
computers only for things like email.

WARNING: Easy edit conflicts with Electric Eyes (an image viewer). If you
have installed Electric Eyes, it must be uninstalled before installing
easyedit. Electric Eyes is not part of a standard Slackware installation.
