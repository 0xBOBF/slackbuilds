# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

filelight: 
filelight: Filelight is an alternative file manager for KDE.  Filelight creates
filelight: an interactive map of concentric segmented-rings that helps you to 
filelight: visualize disk usage on your computer.
filelight: It is like a pie-chart, but the segments are nested, which allows 
filelight: you to see not only which directories take up all your space, but 
filelight: which files and subdirectories are the real culprits.
