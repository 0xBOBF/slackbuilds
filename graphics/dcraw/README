DCRaw is software for processing RAW image files generated by a host of
digital cameras.  DCRaw by itself only provides a command line interface
for image processing.  DCRaw can also build with a gimp plugin so images
can be edited/exported with gimp.

Do this to build the gimp rawphoto plugin: RAWPHOTO=yes ./dcraw.SlackBuild
