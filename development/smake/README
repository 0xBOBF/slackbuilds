smake is a highly portable make program with automake features

smake is targeted to be used with the "makefiles" system as well as 
any general purpose make task. "makefiles" is best used with smake for
convenience and easier debugging because gnu make does not run on all
platforms smake does and because gnu make does not allow to do Makefile 
debugging. Since smake-1.2a26, smake includes a general set of built in
default make rules; this allows smake to be used as a general purpose
make program.

smake installs under /opt/schily/ with other schily applications.
