This script builds dovecot with support for SSL. As such, you must have
openssl installed.  openssl-solibs is not enough in itself to meet this
requirement.  Additionally, dovecot will be compiled with POP3 support.
Unfortunately, dovecot does not have a man page at this time, so you'll
have to find your documentation elsewhere.  A few examples are included
in /usr/doc/dovecot-$VERSION and the dovecot team maintains a wiki that
may prove useful: http://wiki.dovecot.org.

You should probably create a dovecot user to run the login processes on
your server. The build script will exit with an error if you don't have
this user on your system. You should ensure dovecot has a low UID, such
as 91 (this is a low, unused UID on a stock Slackware-11.0 box).

If you have any questions or comments about this script you are free to
contact me via e-mail at <alan@lizella.net>.  Thanks!
