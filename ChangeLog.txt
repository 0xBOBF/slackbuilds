Slackware 12.1 is released! - congratulations to Pat and the rest of the team
  for what is sure to be the new "best Slackware release ever"  ;-)
  We have made a few minor changes here and there, but for the most part,
  this should be the same old SlackBuilds.org that you've grown to love. :)
  There are three new categories (Accessibility, Audio, and Business) in the
  database now, and two of them are relatively empty (hint, hint). 
The following text documents notable information related to our repository
  for 12.1.  If you find something that was part of our 12.0 repository but 
  is not mentioned here, please let us know on the users mailing list.

1. Things removed because they are now part of Slackware
desktop/icon-naming-utils: Removed - this is now part of Slackware.

  advises that he is unable to find any patches for it.

  now anyway.
