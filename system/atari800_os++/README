OS++ is an Open Source rewrite of the ROM operating system for the Atari
XL/XE 8-bit computers, capable of running many games and other programs for
the Atari.

OS++ also includes its own DOS, which is capable of running most
disk-based software that works with Atari DOS 2.0S. OS++ DOS is only
booted if the disk image in drive 1 is not bootable, so it won't conflict
with bootable DOS disks.

OS++ is written in 6502 assembler. You will need cc65 installed to build
this package (though not to run it). cc65 is available at SlackBuilds.org

This version of OS++ has been slightly modified to work with the Atari800
emulator. See /usr/doc/os++-20070109/README.atari800 for more information.

If you have the SlackBuilds.org atari800_roms and atari800_os++ packages
installed, you can adjust the symlink at /usr/share/atari800/atarixl.rom
to choose which OS will run (or, edit ~/.atari800.cfg, or run atari800
with the -xlxe_rom option).

Note: OS++ only replaces the OS ROM. If you want to run BASIC programs,
you will still need an Atari BASIC image, or a freeware/PD BASIC
interpreter such as Turbo BASIC XL.

If you'd rather use the original ROMs, install atari800_roms instead
of this package (or in addition to it, and change the symlink at
/usr/share/atari800/atarixl.rom as desired).
