Leafnode 2 is an NNTP proxy server intended for small sites, where 
there are few users and little disk space, but where a large number of 
groups is desired. It can also be used to give a regular newsreader 
off-line functionality. The leafnode program itself is the server while 
the programs fetchnews and texpire transport the news and expire old 
articles respectively.

There is a little work to do to install this program effectively, all
of which is clearly set out in the README file contained in the source.
It is strongly advised for you to read it thoroughly before installing 
leafnode.  Below is a quick sketch of the requirements for Leafnode setup:

After the installation, you need to:
1. Ensure $NNTPSERVER or /etc/nntpserver point to localhost.
2. Set /etc/inetd.conf so leafnode is executed for incoming NNTP connections.
	nntp  stream  tcp  nowait  news  /usr/sbin/tcpd  /usr/sbin/leafnode
3. Set /etc/hosts.deny and /etc/hosts.allow to protect the server. See the 
   README 
	/etc/hosts.deny: leafnode: ALL
	/etc/hosts.allow: leafnode: 127.0.0.1
4. Create /etc/leafnode/config and adjust settings as required. A sample
   file - /etc/leafnode/config.example - is already there.
5. Set cronjobs for fetchnews and texpire. 
6. Fetch the newsgroup list from your server. 
	/usr/sbin/fetchnews -vv
	/usr/sbin/texpire -vv
   ** texpire will make sure the leafnode news spool is in working order. 
7. Set your newsreader to use the localhost leafnode.

All of this is carefully written up in the README file of the source code and I
stress again the importance of reading that file thorougly. You may also want
