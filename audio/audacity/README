Audacity is free, open source software for recording and editing sounds.
With Audacity one can record live audio, convert tapes and records into
digital recordings, edit Ogg, MP3, and WAV sound files, and much more.

Audacity requires libsndfile and either wxPython or wxGTK, and optional
dependencies are ffmpeg, soundtouch, and twolame.

audacity will be built with support for ffmpeg if it is installed, while
soundtouch and/or twolame support can be enabled in the build script if
installed.  See the build script itself for more information.
