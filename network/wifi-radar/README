WiFi Radar is a Python utility for managing WiFi profiles.  It enables 
you to scan for available networks and create profiles for your preferred 
networks. At boot time, running WiFi Radar will automatically scan for an 
available preferred network and connect to it. You can drag and drop your 
preferred networks to arrange the profile priority.

This script installs a wifi-radar.sh script in /usr/bin that by default 
runs /usr/sbin/wifi-radar with sudo.  You can change this to use ksudo 
instead by running the script thusly:
	./wifi-radar.SlackBuild KSUDO=yes

To use wifi-radar with a normal user (with sudo) add to your /etc/sudoers:
	%users   ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/wifi-radar

Then launch wifi-radar.sh, which will handle setting up a proper environment 
and running /usr/sbin/wifi-radar.

If you want to scan and connect to one of your preferred networks at
boot, the recommended way is to add the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local
and make sure /etc/rc.d/rc.wifi-radar is executable.
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.wifi-radar ]; then
	  /etc/rc.d/rc.wifi-radar start
	fi
And of course, to rc.local_shutdown:
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.wifi-radar ]; then
	  /etc/rc.d/rc.wifi-radar stop
	fi

Please note that according to the manpage, wifi-radar is fairly power hungry 
due to its constant scan nature.  You may not wish to have it running in the 
background all the time sucking battery juice.

Make sure /etc/wifi-radar.conf is only readable by root (or perhaps the
group that owns it in some cases).  We install the file with mode 0600 by
default, but this was not the case in some earlier revisions, so you should
double-check it to be sure. As of version 1.9.9 the config file is now 
/etc/wifi-radar.conf, if you are upgrading you need to move you old config
file to /etc.
