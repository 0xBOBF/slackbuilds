mod_wsgi is a simple to use Apache module which can host any
Python application which supports the Python WSGI interface.
The module would be suitable for use in hosting high performance
production web sites as well as your average personal sites
running on commodity web hosting services.

All major Python web frameworks/applications support mod_wsgi;
that means Django, Pylons, Turbogears, etcetera...

Before using mod_wsgi, stop apache and add the following to
your /etc/httpd/httpd.conf file:
	LoadModule wsgi_module lib/httpd/modules/mod_wsgi.so
