rt61 driver cvs release

Driver for RaLink-based wireless network adapters using the rt61
chipset. This package installs the kernel module and the firmware. It
does NOT contain RaLink's binary configuration file rt61sta.dat. Use
iwconfig to configure your card.

This is a build from the daily snapshots of the source code. The md5sum
cannot be used to check the validity of the downloaded file as it will
change everytime the snapshot is re-generated.

By default, this script will build the driver for your currently 
running kernel.  To build it for a different kernel version, pass it on
the command line when executing the script.  For example:
  KERNEL=2.6.23.1 ./rt61.SlackBuild
Note that you'll need to follow the instructions in /extra for the
nosmp-sdk if you're using one of the stock non-smp Slackware kernels;
for custom kernels, this won't be an issue.
