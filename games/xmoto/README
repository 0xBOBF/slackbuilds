X-Moto is a challenging 2D motocross platform game, where physics play an all 
important role in the gameplay. You need to control your bike to its limit, if 
you want to have a chance finishing the more difficult of the challenges.

IMPORTANT:
X-Moto recently changed its hosting to tuxfamily.org.  As a result, for X-Moto 
to connect to this new server, you have to update the file 'config.dat' located
at ~/.xmoto/config.dat. You can open this file and replace all the occurences 
of xmoto.free.fr with xmoto.tuxfamily.org, or if you don't know how to do that, 
just replace the file config.dat with the one provided in the X-Moto SlackBuild 
tar.gz archive (you will lose your configuration, but not your highscores). 
Moreover, you should remove the file rooms.xml next to this one.
This is only necessary if you want to enable X-Moto to be able to connect to 
the internet.  (from http://xmoto.tuxfamily.org)

Requirements:
  >=lua-5.1         (available @ SlackBuilds.org)
  >=ode-0.7         (available @ SlackBuilds.org)
