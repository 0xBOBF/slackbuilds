iw is a new nl80211 based CLI configuration utility for wireless devices. 
Currently you can only use this utility to configure devices which use a 
mac80211 driver, as these are the new drivers being written - most new 
wireless devices being sold are now SoftMAC. List of mac80211 drivers:

iw requires libnl.
