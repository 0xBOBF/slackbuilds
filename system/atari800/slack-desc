# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

atari800: atari800 (emulator for Atari 800/XL/XE computers and 5200 console)
atari800:
atari800: Atari800 is an Atari 800, 800XL, 130XE and 5200 emulator for Unix,
atari800: Amiga, MS-DOS, Atari TT/Falcon, SDL and WinCE. Our main objective is
atari800: to create a freely distributable portable emulator (i.e. with source
atari800: code available).
atari800:
atari800: To use the emulator, you will need a set of Atari ROM images. Install
atari800: the atari800_roms package to get the official (proprietary) ROM images,
atari800: or the atari800_os++ package to use an Open Source replacement ROM,
atari800: with some loss of compatibility/functionality.
