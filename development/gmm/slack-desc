# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

gmm: gmm (C++ generic matrix template library)
gmm:
gmm: Gmm++ is a generic C++ template library for sparse, dense and
gmm: skyline matrices. It is built as a set of generic algorithms
gmm: (mult, add, copy, sub-matrices, dense and sparse solvers ...)
gmm: for any interfaced vector type or matrix type. It can be view
gmm: as a glue library allowing cooperation between several vector
gmm: and matrix types. However, basic sparse, dense and skyline
gmm: matrix/vector types are built in Gmm++, hence it can be used
gmm: as a standalone linear algebra library.
