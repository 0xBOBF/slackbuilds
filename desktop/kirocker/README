Kirocker 
Make your Kicker (the KDE main panel) rock with your music.

It is a Kicker applet that displays what you listen to in Amarok.
A full-screen display can also be used independently of the applet.

With this panel applet, you always know what you are listening to, 
and can watch its cover and star rating: it is always visible.
