pmount is a wrapper around the standard mount program which permits
normal users to mount removable devices without a matching
/etc/fstab entry.

The program also includes "pmount-hal" which reads information from
hal (device labels, mount options) and passes them to pmount.
Note that this pmoumt SlackBuild by default uses --enable-hal since
hal is included in Slackware 12.0.

After installing pmount, you've to be sure the users you want to be
able to use it are in "plugdev" group.

You can read pmount's man page if you want detailed information.
