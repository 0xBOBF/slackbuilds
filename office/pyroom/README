PyRoom is a free editor that stays out your way - and keeps other things out
of your way, too. As a fullscreen editor without buttons, widgets, formatting
options, menus and with only the minimum of required dialog windows, it
doesn't have any distractions and lets you focus on writing and only writing.

It is distributed under the GNU General Public Licence v3.

PyRoom requires PyGTK (provided by Slackware) and PyXDG (provided
by Slackbuilds.org).
