Erlang (programming language)

Erlang is a general-purpose concurrent programming language and runtime 
system.  The sequential subset of Erlang is a functional language, with 
strict evaluation, single assignment, and dynamic typing. It was designed 
by Ericsson to support distributed, fault-tolerant, soft-real-time, 
non-stop applications.

The post-install script will add some files to the /usr/lib/erlang 
directory, at it does not seem to be possible to create these files
when the package is created.  Therefore, if you uninstall this package,
be sure to remove the /usr/lib/erlang/ directory afterward.
