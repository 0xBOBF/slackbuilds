QT Disk Usage
 
qdu is a graphical disk usage utility based on Qt.  It lets you find which
directories occupy the largest disk space at a glance. Folders can be open
to get a detailed view. You can apply file filters to focus on specific 
file types. File deletion is also possible (files are simply moved).
