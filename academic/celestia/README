A real-time space simulation that lets you experience our universe
in three dimensions.

There are four frontend possibilities to choose. The Glut and KDE one
do work out of the box. The GTK frontend needs gtkglext (also available
from SlackBuilds.org). The Gnome frontend wasn't tested.

Celestia may use lua for its script engine, if available at compile time.
Lua is also available from SlackBuilds.org.
