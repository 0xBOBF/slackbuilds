VICE is the one and only Versatile Commodore Emulator. It provides emulation 
of the Commodore C64, C128, VIC20, PET, PLUS4 and CBM-II computers.

If you are building this on Slamd64, execute the build script as follows:
  ARCH=x86_64 ./vice.SlackBuild

If you build on a multicore system, add JOBS={core #} to enable parallel
compilation, as in:   JOBS=4 ./vice.SlackBuild
which starts up to 4 build jobs simultaneously.
