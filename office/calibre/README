Calibre is an e-book library manager. It can view, convert and catalog
e-books in most of the major e-book formats. It can also talk to e-book
reader devices. It can go out to the internet and fetch metadata for your
books. It can download newspapers and convert them into e-books for
convenient reading. It is cross platform, running on Linux, Windows
and OS X.

Requires: pysetuptools, lxml, python-dateutil, pil, BeautifulSoup,
ClientForm, mechanize, dnspython, qt4, sip, and pyqt4.

Optional: unrar and openjpeg.

Warning: It is best to uninstall calibre first before upgrading to a new
version.

Warning: This package conflicts with pyPdf, CherryPy and cssutils, as it
provides its own copy of these programs.

Note: The ebook viewer functionality doesn't work with Qt 4.5.0 and
pyqt4 4.4.4. However, it does work with Qt 4.4.3 and pyqt4 4.4.4. As an
alternative, FBReader is a good choice to view downloaded content on the
desktop.
