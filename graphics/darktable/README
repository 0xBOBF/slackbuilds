Darktable is a virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers.
It manages your digital negatives in a database and lets you view them
through a zoomable lighttable.  It also enables you to develop raw images
and enhance them.  This project tries to fill the gap between the many
excellent existing free raw converters and image management tools (such
as ufraw or f-spot).

This requires lensfun and GConf.  gnome-keyring is optional (if you want
to enable it, pass GKEYRING=yes to the script).
