The MiniUPnP daemon (MiniUPnPd) is software which supports the
UPnP Internet Gateway Device (IGD) specifications and the NAT Port
Mapping Protocol (NAT-PMP).

UPnP-IGD and NAT-PMP are used to improve internet connectivity for
devices behind a NAT router. Any peer to peer network application
such as games, IM, etc. can benefit from a NAT router supporting
UPnP and/or NAT-PMP.

Edit the config files before starting (including the .sh files)
