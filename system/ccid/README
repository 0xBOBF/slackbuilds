libccid provides a PC/SC IFD handler implementation for the USB smart card
drivers compliant to the Chip Card Interface Device (CCID) protocol.

This package is needed to communicate with the CCID smartcard readers
through the PC/SC Lite resource manager (pcscd).  It also supports various
Gemplus serial smart card readers.

This package depends on pcsc-lite, which can be found at SlackBuilds.org.

You will need to edit the pcsc-lite config files to be able to use serial
smart card readers.  The INSTALL file in the documentation directory has
all the details.
