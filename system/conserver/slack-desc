conserver: Conserver (Console server)
conserver:
conserver: Conserver is an application that allows multiple users to watch
conserver: a (serial) console at the same time.  It can log the data, allows
conserver: to take write-access of a console (one at a time), and has a
conserver: variety of bells and whistles to accentuate that basic
conserver: functionality. Basically it can consolidate out-off-band
conserver: management / data. Conserver is maintained by Bryan Stansell.
