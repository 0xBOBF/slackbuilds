transcode is a text-console utility for video stream processing.
Decoding and encoding is done by loading modules that are responsible for 
feeding transcode with raw video/audio streams (import modules) and encoding 
the frames (export modules). It supports elementary video and audio frame 
transformations, including de-interlacing or fast resizing of video frames 
and loading of external filters.

Requires ffmpeg, libmpeg2 (also called mpeg2dec), lame, libdv, libquicktime,
libdvdread or libdvdnav, and a52dec (all available from SlackBuilds.org).
