wicd is a wired and wireless network manager for Linux.

Some features include:
- Ability to connect to wired and wireless networks
- Profiles for each wireless network and wired network
- Many encryption schemes, some of which include WEP/WPA/WPA2
- Compatible with wireless-tools 

You will need to start the wicd service at boot by adding the
following to your /etc/rc.d/rc.local:
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.wicd ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.wicd start
  fi

You'll also need to prevent the standard Slackware networking scripts from 
starting the network.  The easiest way to do this is to remove any interface 
definitions from /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1.conf
Alternatively, there are two optional patches (not applied by default)
included in the script tarball and commented out in the build script.  
With those patches applied, wicd should work "out of the box" with 
unmodified Slackware networking scripts, but the only promise I can make is 
"WFM - YMMV" (Works For Me - Your Mileage May Vary). :)

This requires dbus-python and pygtk; also, you will need to restart or 
reload the messagebus service after installing wicd.
