Jinja2 (Template engine for Python)

Jinja2 is a template engine written in pure Python.  It provides a
Django inspired non-XML syntax but supports inline expressions and
an optional sandboxed  environment.

To build, this requires pysetuptools.

Circular dependencies warning:

The DOCS=yes flag needs Sphinx to build python docs, it and needs Jinja2
but that needs Sphinx because you have set its DOCS=yes flag.
If you really need the docs, build Jinja2 without the DOCS=yes flag
and build Sphinx then rebuild Jinja2 with DOCS=yes.

Incidentally, unless you are a developer, you don't normally need the
DOCS=yes flag.
