pommed enables the use of the brightness and volume keys on Apple
laptops including the MacBook and MacBook Pro (the only Apple laptops
that Slackware currently runs on) and is likely of little or not use to
others.  pommed requires libsmbios and libconfuse, both of which can be 
found at SlackBuilds.org.

This package installs an rc.pommed script that should be called from
rc.local (and optionally rc.local_shutdown) like so:

  In rc.local:
  # Start pommed
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.pommed ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.pommed start
  fi

  In rc.local_shutdown:
  # Stop pommed
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.pommed ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.pommed stop
  fi

It is also necessary to restart dbus after installing this package, either by
a reboot or a quick restart of just the service:
  /etc/rc.d/rc.messagebus restart
