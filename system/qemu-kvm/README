KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution
for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions
(Intel VT or AMD-V).  KVM is divided into the KVM-KMOD package
(kernel modules) and the QEMU-KVM package (slightly modified QEMU)
which are both available as separate Slackbuilds.

QEMU-KVM is a generic and open source virtualizer.  QEMU-KVM achieves
near native performances by leveraging the KVM-KMOD modules and
executing the guest code directly on the host CPU.  QEMU-KVM can
virtualize many system guest types (e.g. alpha, arm, i386, ppc, x86_64,
s390, sparc).  Slackware provides pre-built KVM-KMOD modules or you
can build different versions with the KVM-KMOD SlackBuild.

QEMU-KVM requires a system group and uses 'kvm' as the default.  If you
want to use a different group like 'users' then run the script like this:
KVMGROUP=users sh qemu-kvm.SlackBuild

After package installation, make sure you have the KVMGROUP present on
your system and that all desired users are members of that group.
Don't forget to load the KVM-INTEL or KVM-AMD module depending on your
processor.
