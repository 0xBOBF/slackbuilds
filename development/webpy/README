web.py is a simple and powerful web framework for Python. It
provides a simple database abstraction, a template engine, and
abstractions for HTTP requests. A simple webserver is also included,
which can be used to quickly try and test code.

web.py does not have any additional requirements than stock Python
from Slackware Linux. To use the database functionality, you could
install pysqlite2, psycopg2, or MySQLdb modules.
