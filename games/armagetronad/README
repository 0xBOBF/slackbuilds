armagetronad (a Tron clone in 3D)

A Tron 'Light Cycles' clone that offers up to 16 players, a highly
advanced AI, and network/internet play in a full 3D environment

This build includes the game client and Master server.  It will install
system-wide configuration into /etc/armagetron.

Full documentation exists in /usr/doc/armagetronad-<version>/

The armagetronad server initscript is stored as:
/usr/share/games/armagetronad/scripts/rcd_master
To use this script, symlink it to /etc/rc.d with this command:
ln -s /usr/share/games/armagetronad/scripts/rcd_master /etc/rc.d/rc.armagetronad

The armagetronad server system-wide install scripts enable the creation
of a user called 'armagetronad' for use with the Master server.  This
user isn't created by default by this package.  If you would like to
create this user in the same fashion as the armagetronad system-wide
install script, the user creation section is shown below.  You may
choose to use this by creating a script with the contents below or
create a user manually.


user=armagetronad

if test -w /etc/passwd; then
    echo "Creating user ${user}..."

    if which useradd > /dev/null 2>&1; then
        useradd ${user} || echo -e "\nWarning: unable to create user with 'useradd'. Giving up.\n"
    else

        if which pw > /dev/null 2>&1; then
            pw useradd ${user} || echo "Warning: unable to create user with 'pw'. Giving up."
        else
            echo -e "\nWarning: unable to find suitable program to add user.\n"
        fi

    fi

    else # no write acces to /etc/passwd
        echo -e "\nWarning: no write access to /etc/passwd, can't add user.\n"
fi
