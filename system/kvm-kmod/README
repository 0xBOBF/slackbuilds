KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution
for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions
(Intel VT or AMD-V).  KVM is divided into the KVM-KMOD package
(kernel modules) and the QEMU-KVM package (slightly modified QEMU)
which are both available as separate Slackbuilds.

KVM-KMOD consists of a kernel module, 'kvm.ko', that provides the
core virtualization infrastructure and a processor specific module,
'kvm-intel.ko' or 'kvm-amd.ko'.  Slackware provides these modules
in the 'a/slackware-modules*' packages and the associated headers
in the 'd/slackware-headers*' packages.  In most cases the
Slackware provided versions are sufficient to run QEMU-KVM.
KVM-KMOD is only needed if you want to change the KVM modules and
headers to a different version.

KVM-KMOD updates the modules and headers without overwriting the
Slackware provided versions.  If you uninstall KVM-KMOD you will
need to run 'depmod -a' to regenerate the modules.dep and map
files to regain access to the Slackware provided versions.
