gThumb is an image viewer and browser for the GNOME desktop.  It also
includes an importer tool for transferring photos from cameras.
 
gThumb supports printing multiple images on a single page using a printer 
while many other image viewers don't support it.  Thus, it comes handy.

This requires GConf and libunique, and evince is needed for runtime.
clutter, libsoup, gnome-keyring, and brasero are optional dependencies.
