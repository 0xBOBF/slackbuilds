Command-line interface to the X Clipboard

xclip is a command line utility that is designed to run on any system
with an X11 implementation. It can read data from standard input or a
file and place it in an X selection for pasting into other X
applications. xclip can also print an X selection to standard output,
which can then be redirected to a file or another program.
