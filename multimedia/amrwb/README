amrnb - AMR Wide Band Speech Codec

This is library is an effort to link against the amrwb-codec,
standardized by the 3GPP, and used in modern mobile-phones
when recording video or speech, for example.

The library itself is actually just a wrapper around the original code
released by 3GPP.

You will need to get the 26204-700.zip file and place it in the same
directory as the SlackBuild script *before* attempting to build this.
