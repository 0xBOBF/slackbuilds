Pd-extended (Pure Data, by Miller Puckette) is a real-time
audio synthesis/processing package. It is one of the
"MUSIC N" family members, open source (BSD style) successor
of the MAX branch. This package contains the core of Pd and
many external objects.

Since this version the programs binaries name is pdextended,
in order to start Pd-extended you have to call it with this
name.

Pd-extended is usually based on an older version of Pd.
Since version 0.42.5 Pd-extended doesn't conflict any more
with Pd.

You find an example for $HOME/.pdextended in
/usr/doc/Pd-<version>-extended/example.pdextended
which should work out of the box on most machines and
will enable most of the external libraries in pd.

It requires dssi, gsl, imlib2, jack-audio-connection-kit,
ladspa_sdk, lame, liblo, libquicktime and speex at compile
time.
