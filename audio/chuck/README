ChucK is a new (and developing) audio programming language for real-time
synthesis, composition, performance, and now, analysis.

ChucK presents a new time-based, concurrent programming model that's highly
precise and expressive (we call this strongly-timed), as well as dynamic
control rates, and the ability to add and modify code on-the-fly. In addition,
ChucK supports MIDI, OSC, HID device, and multi-channel audio. It's fun and
easy to learn, and offers composers, researchers, and performers a powerful
programming tool for building and experimenting with complex audio
synthesis/analysis programs, and real-time interactive control.

Please e-mail me if it works for 64-bit.
