Smooth GTK1/GTK2 Theme Engine is a simple theme engine intended to be
smooth, fast, and highly configurable, such that it could eventually
mimic most, if not all, major theme engines to high degree of acuracy,
while still retaining a small footprint.

This package does NOT include support for GTK1 or Cairo.
