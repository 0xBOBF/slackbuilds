pmidi is a command line midi player for ALSA.

This is a straightforward command line program to play midi files
through the ALSA sequencer.
As you can specify the client and port to connect to on the command
line it is also useful for testing ALSA or clients that need to
receive sequencer events.

This program works with latest ALSA 1.0 drivers and former O.9
versions.
