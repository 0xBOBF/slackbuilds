The Duke3D High Resolution Pack allows you to use much better looking
textures than the original game (released back in 1996) had to offer
in the first place. It also introduces 3D model replacements for the
old enemies/weapons/items sprites. In combination with an OpenGL port
like JFDuke3D or EDuke32, this gives Duke Nukem 3D a modernized, more
appealing look and even motivates Duke veterans to play through the
original episodes once again.

This package is intended for use with the eduke32 package from
slackbuilds.org, but may also be used with other Duke3D source ports.

If you've installed this package, but for some reason want to run eduke32
without it, remove the ~/.eduke32/autoload symlink and create an empty
~/.eduke32/autoload directory.
