tint2 is a simple panel/taskbar intentionally made for openbox3, but should
also work with other window managers.  It's based off ttm code.

The goal is to keep a clean and unintrusive look with lightweight code and
compliance with freedesktop specifications.

This requires imlib2.

On the first run, /etc/xdg/tint2/tint2rc is copied to ~/.config/tint2/tint2rc
and used as the default configuration.  Other samples are included in
/usr/doc/tint2-*/sample/ ; you can edit ~/.config/tint2/tint2rc as desired.
