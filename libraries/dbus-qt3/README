qt3 bindings for the dbus IPC library.

This is the old bindings package needed for KDE 3.5.4, but it works
with dbus-1.x.  If you want to build the newer bindings for qt3
(the ones that were backported from the qt4 bindings), this script
should support that with a few modifications - see the SlackBuild script
for more information.

This requires the dbus package (available at SlackBuilds.org), and you
will need to start the messagebus service prior to building this.
