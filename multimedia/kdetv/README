kdetv is a KDE application that allows you to watch television on
your GNU/Linux box running KDE.  Features of kdetv include three
view modes, deinterlacing, overscan, a channel scanner, the ability
to import the channel files of three other TV-tuner applications,
teletext and closed caption decoding, and an easy-to-use graphical
interface.  The application supports remote controls using KDELIRC.
kdetv was previously known as QtVision or kwintv3.
