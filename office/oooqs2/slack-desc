# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

oooqs2: It is a small systray applet for KDE to preload OpenOffice.org into
oooqs2: memory to make it start faster and designed to comply in great parts
oooqs2: with its counterpart on Windows systems that is delivered with
oooqs2: OpenOffice.org. In addition, and that's certainly the most important
oooqs2: part, it's finally compatible with OpenOffice.org 2.
