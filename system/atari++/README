The Atari++ Emulator is a Unix based emulator of the Atari eight bit
computers, namely the Atari 400 and 800, the Atari 600XL, 800XL and 130XE,
and the Atari 5200 game console. The emulator is auto-configurable and
will compile on a variety of systems (Linux, Solaris, Irix), and supports
many emulation features.

Atari++ includes OS++, an open source replacement Atari 8-bit operating
system, so it's able to run many games and applications without the
Atari ROM images. However, for maximum compatibility, you probably will
want the original ROMs. To get them, install the atari800_roms package,
then use the atari++ GUI to set the ROM file paths to the images in
/usr/share/atari800/roms/. There is no need to install the atari800_os++
package for use with atari++ (OS++ is built into the emulator).

Notes:

1. Atari++, by default, is built with a fancy set of CFLAGS that the
author includes in his makefile. If you're picky about such things, or if
you run into crashes or compile errors, try setting FORCE_SLACK_CFLAGS=yes
in the environment before running atari++.SlackBuild

2. The Atari++ author doesn't use a version number in the filename of
the atari++.tgz distribution, and doesn't keep old versions available
on the site. This script was written for Atari++ version 1.55. By the
time you read this, there may be a new release. This script will extract
the version number from atari++.tgz and set the VERSION in the package
correctly, so you don't need to edit anything... but if there have been
major changes to the Atari++ codebase, the script might fail on the
latest version. Please contact the maintainer, in that case.
