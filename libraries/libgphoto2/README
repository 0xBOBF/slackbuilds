libgphoto2 is a library that can be used by applications to access 
various digital cameras.

The resulting package checks /var/log/packages for your installed udev
version and generates udev rules in the post-install stage.  For those 
of you still using the old hotplug subsystem, it also adds the file 
/etc/hotplug/usb/usbcam during the packaging and appends some text to 
/etc/hotplug/usb.usermap in the post-install stage.  This appending is 
not normally something that we would do with any of our scripts, but in 
this case, it should be completely harmless; however, a backup copy of 
the file is left in the same directory just in case.

Since version 2.3.1 build 3, there are two different groups granting
access to your digital camera for non-root users via udev and hotplug. 

From now on the udev rules generated during install set device ownership
to the 'plugdev' group.  If this group does not yet exist (users of HAL
should have this group already), you will need to create it and add any 
users that may access the camera. A recommended way for adding the 'plugdev' 
group would be:

  /usr/sbin/groupadd -g 83 plugdev

Hotplug users still have to use the group 'camera' and add any users that
should be permitted to access the camera to this group. Alternatively, 
you can edit the included doinst.sh file to change "group plugdev" to 
"group users" (if you're using udev) or edit /etc/hotplug/usb/usbcam after 
the package is installed and change "camera" to "users" (if you're using 
hotplug) if you want all users to have access to cameras.

The resulting package *should* work without any manual setup, but in our
testing here, it seems that some cameras aren't recognized by the installed
udev rules.  There is at least one reliable report of a change that *may* be
needed if you're using udev-097 from Slackware 11.0:

  This:
    BUS!="usb*", GOTO="libgphoto2_rules_end"
  should perhaps be this:
    SUBSYSTEM!="usb*", GOTO="libgphoto2_rules_end"

However, if the rules installed by libgphoto2 work for you, don't change
anything - this should only be done if they don't work.  Note that this is
*not* a bug in the build script or implementation - we just use the provided
tools with libgphoto2 to generate the udev rules; as such, any bug reports 
with the udev rules should go to them (feel free to CC our -users list).
