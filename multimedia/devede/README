DeVeDe is a program to create video DVDs and CDs (VCD, sVCD, or CVD), suitable
for home players from any number of video files, in any of the formats 
supported by MPlayer. 

DeVeDe requires dvdauthor, vcdimager, and MPlayer.

Since new versions of DeVeDe are released frequently, to build a newer version
than the one this script was written for, try:

	VERSION=x.y.x ./devede.SlackBuild
