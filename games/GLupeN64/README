GLupeN64 is mupen64plus + RSP-HLE + GLideN64 + libretro.

Some games need to read a file called 'mupen64plus.ini' to function properly,
for instance, you might get a "No Controller" message in Banjo-Tooie.

The file is located inside the 'mupen64plus-core/data' folder. It needs to be
copied to your RetroArch system dir, which will be the directory your ROM is
located if you haven't set it.

To build the debugging symbols use:
  DEBUG=1 ./GLupeN64.SlackBuild
