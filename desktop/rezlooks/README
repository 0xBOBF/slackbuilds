Rezlooks is an alternative GTK engine created by rezza on GNOME-Look.org.
It is based on the cairo-enabled CVS Clearlooks engine code and has been
stripped down and modified.

Themes can be found by searching for "rezlooks" on gnome-look.org. Due to the
nature of the engine, all the themes look roughly the same except for the
color.

To install themes, decompress and untar the theme. The resulting directory
should then be placed in ~/.themes/ or /usr/share/themes/. There are several
methods to set the theme. If you use a GTK-based desktop environment, a
utility should be included to help you set the theme. Otherwise, you can
manually edit ~/.gtkrc-2.0 or use a software lik gtk-chtheme (http://
slackbuilds.org/repository/12.1/desktop/gtk-chtheme/) to edit the file for
you.
