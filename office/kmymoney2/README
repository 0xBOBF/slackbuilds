KmyMoney 2 is a simple financial accounting manager for KDE for personal or 
small-business use.  It is a full double-entry accounting software package
compatible with KDE 3.2.x and later.

The ultimate objectives of KMyMoney are...

  * Familiar Features. KMyMoney intends to provide all important features 
    found in the commercially-available, personal finance managers. The 
    current release is closer than ever to that goal and more improvements 
    are already planned or being tested.

  * Ease of use. KMyMoney strives to be the easiest open source personal 
    finance manager to use, especially for the non-technical user.

  * Accuracy. Using time tested double entry accounting principles KMyMoney 
    can help ensure that your finances are kept in correct order.

This compiles a package without support for kbanking or ofxbanking.
