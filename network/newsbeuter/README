Newsbeuter is an RSS feedreader.  RSS is a widely-used XML format 
to transmit, publish, and syndicate articles (e.g. news or blogs).
Newsbeuter is designed to be used on text terminals on Unix-like 
systems.  This package also includes podbeuter, a manager for 
downloading podcasts using RSS feeds.
