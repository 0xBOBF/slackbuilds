kamera (digital camera kio_slave)

Kamera (part of kdegraphics) lets you browse your camera from within 
konqueror (URL: camera:/) and is configured via the control center (kcontrol).
This is actually part of kdegraphics, but since it requires libgphoto2 to
compile, it's not part of the stock kdegraphics package; note that this
kamera package will NOT conflict with stock kdegraphics.

Kamera depends on libgphoto2, which is available from Slackbuilds.org.
