Google Gadgets for Linux provides a platform for running desktop gadgets under
Linux, catering to the unique needs of Linux users. It's compatible with the
gadgets written for Google Desktop for Windows as well as the Universal
Gadgets on iGoogle. Following Linux norms, this project is open-sourced under
the Apache License. 

By default Google Gadgets will build a GTK+ interface. If you also want a GUI
based on the QT library, you will need to have QT4 installed at compile time.
A SlackBuild for QT4 is available at SlackBuilds.org.

Note: this will not build if webkit is installed.
