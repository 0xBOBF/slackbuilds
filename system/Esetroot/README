Esetroot without all the Eterm baggage

Esetroot is used to set wallpaper for window which support translucency.
It supports JPG and PNG image formats while fvwm-root does not support JPG.
Esetroot can be used in the fvwm config file.

Esetroot requires the imlib2 library which is available in the "Libraries" 
category at SlackBuilds.org.
