Skim is an input method platform based upon scim-lib under *NIX (including 
GNU/Linux and FreeBSD) systems optimized for KDE. It provides a GUI panel 
(named scim-panel-kde), a KConfig config module and SetupUIs for itself and 
scim-lib. It also has its own plugin systems which support on-demand loadable
actions.

Please refer to the skim Handbook for configuration instructions:
