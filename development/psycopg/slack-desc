# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

psycopg: psycopg (PostgreSQL adapter for python)
psycopg:
psycopg: psycopg is a PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python
psycopg: programming language (just like pygresql and popy.) It was
psycopg: written from scratch with the aim of being very small and fast,
psycopg: and stable as a rock. The main advantages of psycopg are that
psycopg: it supports (well... *will* support) the full Python DBAPI-2.0
psycopg: and being thread safe at level 2.
