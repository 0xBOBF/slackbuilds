Enlightenment DR17 is the next generation of UNIX graphical
environments.  It is not just a window manager, but it is also a
desktop shell.  A desktop shell means a window manager plus a file
manager plus configuration utilities all in one.

Enlightenment is dependent upon the following packages (build them
exactly in the order given): eet, evas, ecore, e_dbus, efreet, embryo
and edje.
