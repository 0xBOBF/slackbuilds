Guarddog is a firewall configuration utility for Linux systems.  Guarddog is 
aimed at two groups of users: novice to intermediate users who are not experts 
in TCP/IP networking and security, and those users who don't want the hassle 
of dealing with cryptic shell scripts and iptables parameters.

Guarddog should work "out of the box" on any standard stock Slackware 12.0
installation.

You will need to add the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local in order to have
the firewall script that Guarddog creates started at boot:
  if [ -x /etc/rc.firewall ]; then
    /etc/rc.firewall
  fi
It seems that Guarddog hard-codes this location, so there's no way to change
it when building.  Since a standard Slackware system will execute a firewall
script at boot if one exists (and is executable) at /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall,
you might consider doing the following instead:
  ln -s /etc/rc.firewall /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall
