# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

gccxml: GCC-XML (XML output extension to GCC)

gccxml: The purpose of the GCC-XML extension is to generate an XML
gccxml: description of a C++ program from GCC's internal
gccxml: representation.  Since XML is easy to parse, other development
gccxml: tools will be able to work with C++ programs without the burden
gccxml: of a complicated C++ parser.
