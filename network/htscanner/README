Htscanner allows one to use htaccess-like files to configure PHP
on a per-directory basis, just like Apache's htaccess. It is
especially useful with fastcgi.

Please read the "Description" part of /usr/doc/htscanner-<version>/README
after installation. An example [htscanner] block for php.ini is included
in /usr/doc/htscanner-<version>/htscanner.ini this can be appended to
/etc/httpd/php.ini (after editing to ones preferences).

Currently, for example, something like:

cat << EOF > /var/www/htdocs/.htaccess 
<IfModule mod_php.c>
        php_value register_globals On
</IfModule>
EOF

cat /usr/doc/htscanner-0.8.1/htscanner.ini >> /etc/httpd/php.ini

sh /etc/rc.d/rc.httpd stop
sh /etc/rc.d/rc.httpd start
