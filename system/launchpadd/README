A novation launchpad midi driver.

It is not a driver in the common sense, but a user space usb
application which offers a midi out and in to write and receive
launchpad midi messages.

During installation this will set the group to plugdev for all
devices in /dev/bus/usb and mode to 664. In order to run the
application you need to be in the plugdev group. After installing
udev needs to be restarted in order to run the programm.
