Freepats is a project to create a free and open set of instrument patches.

To use these patches with TiMidity++, add the following line to
/etc/timidity/timidity.cfg (minus the quotes):
  'source $basedir/freepats.cfg'
Alternatively, use crude.cfg instead of freepats.cfg to use substitute
patches that fill in missing entries in the tone bank.
