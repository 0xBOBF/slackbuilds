Monsterz is a little arcade puzzle game, similar to the famous Bejeweled or 
Zookeeper.
The goal of the game is to create rows of similar monsters, either horizontally
or vertically. The only allowed move is the swap of two adjacent monsters, on 
the condition that it creates a row of three or more. When alignments are 
cleared, pieces fall from the top of the screen to fill the board again. Chain 
reactions earn you even more points. 
This game is mostly about luck, but it remains highly addictive. You have been 
warned.

This requires recent versions of python, SDL, and pygame (pygame is also 
available from SlackBuilds.org).
