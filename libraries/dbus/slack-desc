dbus: D-Bus message bus system for interprocess communication
dbus: 
dbus: D-Bus supplies both a system daemon (for events such as "new hardware
dbus: device added" or "printer queue changed") and a per-user-login-session
dbus: daemon (for general IPC needs among user applications). Also, the message
dbus: bus is built on top of a general one-to-one message passing framework,
dbus: which can be used by any two apps to communicate directly (without going
dbus: through the message bus daemon).
