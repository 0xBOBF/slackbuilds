Herrie - interactive music playlist player

Herrie is a minimalistic music player that uses the command line. It is written
to support a variety of audio subsystems and file formats, including playlists.
 
Herrie has a split-screen user interface, with a playlist at the top of the 
screen and a file browser at the bottom.  Herrie supports XMMS shortcuts for
playback control and can play in XMMS mode or "party" mode (which acts as a 
song queue).
 
Herrie also has some more exotic features, including support for AudioScrobbler
and the ability to chroot() itself into a directory.  The default options for 
this Slackbuild are set for no scrobbler, http, nls, modplugin, wave, or XSPF 
support.  ALSA is the chosen sound output and Ncurses (NOT Ncursesw) is the chosen
'gui'. This makes it so the program can be built with the least amount of 
dependencies (with these options all of them should be included in 
Slackware 12). See the README in the herrie source for the dependencies 
needed if you enable these other options.

Also see README.SBo for useage and configuration help.
