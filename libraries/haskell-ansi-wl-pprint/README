This is a pretty printing library based on Wadler's paper A Prettier
Printer.  It has been enhanced with support for ANSI terminal colored
output using the ansi-terminal package.

This requires ghc, and haskell-ansi-terminal.

After uninstalling, run this command to unregister the package from
the ghc package database:   ghc-pkg recache
