gPodder is a GTK2 media aggregator

gPodder is a podcast receiver/catcher written in Python utilizing PyGTK for
its user interface.  gPodder allows the user to subscribe to RSS feeds for
podcasts, videocasts, and other similar content and download media files
found in those feeds.  gPodder has system-tray notifications, remote access 
to the gpodder.net web services and optional support for Bluetooth and iPod 
synchronization.

This application requires python and vorbis-tools, part of the
standard Slackware installation.  It also requires feedparser and mygpoclient,
both of which can be found here at SlackBuilds.org.
