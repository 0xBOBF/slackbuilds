UrbanTerror is an urban combat themed First Person Shooter.
Urban Terror started as a realism based "total conversion" mod for 
Quake III Arena. Nowadays, Urban Terror is played using the free, 
stand-alone, ioquake3 engine modified, which doesn't require 
Quake III Arena, in addition to being an add-on to id Software's.
