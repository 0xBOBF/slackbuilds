zope.component (Zope Component Architecture)

This package represents the core of the Zope Component Architecture.
Together with the 'zope.interface' package, it provides facilities
for defining, registering and looking up components.

This requires zope.event and zope.interface.

To build, this requires pysetuptools.

Additional functionality is provided, if zope.hookable,
zope.i18nmessageid, zope.configuration, and/or ZODB3 are installed.
