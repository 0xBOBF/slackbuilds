emelFM2 is a file manager for UNIX-like operating systems.  It uses
a simple and efficient interface pioneered by Norton Commander in
the 1980's.  It features a two pane window located side-by-side
to show the contents of the selected filesystem directories, and
a third pane at the bottom that shows the output of commands.

This build includes support for the gamin file-alteration
monitoring system that is part of a default full Slackware install.
Users can disable gamin by removing 'GAMIN=1' from the 'make install'
line of the SlackBuild.
