SpliX is a set of CUPS printer drivers for SPL(Samsung Printer Language) printers.
It covers several Samsung and Xerox printers. See ppd/*.ppd in the tarball 
for supported models. Only SPL2 and SPLc printers are currently supported.
However work is in progress to implement support for SPL printers.

Requirements: cupsddk (slackbuild available at slackbuilds.org)
