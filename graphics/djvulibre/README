DjVu is a web-centric format and software platform for distributing
documents and images. DjVu can advantageously replace PDF, PS, TIFF,
JPEG, and GIF for distributing scanned documents, digital documents,
or high-resolution pictures. DjVu content downloads faster, displays
and renders faster, looks nicer on a screen, and consume less client
resources than competing formats. DjVu images display instantly and can
be smoothly zoomed and panned with no lengthy re-rendering. DjVu is used
by hundreds of academic, commercial, governmental, and non-commercial
web sites around the world.

DjVuLibre includes a standalone viewer, a browser plug-in (for Mozilla,
Firefox, Konqueror, Netscape, Galeon, and Opera), and command line tools
(decoders, encoders, utilities). DjVuLibre works under Unix with X11.

Requires xdg-utils (also available from SlackBuilds.org).
