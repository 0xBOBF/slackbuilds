Streamripper records SHOUTcast and Icecast compatible streams.
It uses meta data within a SHOUTcast stream to determine the
beginning and end of each song, and stores the songs on your
hard disk as individual mp3 files. In addition, Streamripper
includes a relay server for listening to the station while
you are recording.

tre (also available at http://www.slackbuilds.org/) is
required to build this package. However, Streamripper will
use an included tre library if you add --with-included-tre
to the ./configure section of the SlackBuild.
