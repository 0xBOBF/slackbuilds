mftrace - Scalable PostScript Fonts for MetaFont

mftrace is a small Python program that lets you trace a TeX bitmap
font into a PFA or PFB font (A PostScript Type1 Scalable Font) or
TTF (TrueType) font.  mftrace is a thin Python wrapper around some
other programs that do the real work:  a tracing program and t1asm.

Dependencies:

* A tracing program
   autotrace >= 0.30 (http://autotrace.sourceforge.net)
     or potrace (http://potrace.sourceforge.net)
  Potrace is recommended as it runs quicker than autotrace, and it
    is also available from SlackBuilds.org.
* Python 2.1 or later (http://www.python.org/)
* t1utils (http://www.lcdf.org/~eddietwo/type/)
* TeX â€“- your TeX installation should include kpsewhich and MetaFont
* FontForge is recommended.
