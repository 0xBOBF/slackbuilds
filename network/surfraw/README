Surfraw - Shell Users' Revolutionary Front Rage Against the Web

Surfraw provides a fast unix command line interface to a variety of
popular WWW search engines and other artifacts of power. It reclaims
google, altavista, babelfish, dejanews, freshmeat, research index,
slashdot, and many others from the false-prophet, pox-infested heathen
lands of html-forms, placing these wonders where they belong, deep in
unix heartland, as god loving extensions to the shell.

The script uses a configure switch in order to enable the opensearch elvi.
If you want to use it run it with OPENSEARCH=true in which case libwww-perl
is a dependency.

Mind that the global configuration files in /etc/xdg/surfraw ALWAYS get higher
priority than per user ones in $HOME/.config/surfraw if they are present, so
it might be preferable editing them instead of copying them to your $HOME.
