This is the README for the SlackBuild for the Newsbeuter RSS feedreader.

Newsbeuter is an RSS feedreader. RSS is a number of widely-used
XML formats to transmit, publish and syndicate articles, for
example news or blog articles. Newsbeuter is designed to be used
on text terminals on Unix or Unix-like systems such as Linux,
BSD or Mac OS X.

You will need to have stfl and sqlite (from SlackBuilds.org) installed to 
build this, and swig is an optional dependency if you want ruby scripting 
support.  Note that stfl will need to have been built with swig installed
(from SlackBuilds.org) as well if you want the additional ruby scripting 
support. However, the author of the script has been unsuccessful in getting
ruby scripting support to build; there is a variable in the build script
to enable, so if you have any luck, please notify the maintainer listed in
the newsbeuter.info file.
