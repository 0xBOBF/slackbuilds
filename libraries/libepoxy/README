Epoxy is a library for handling OpenGL function pointer management for you.

It hides the complexity of dlopen(), dlsym(), glXGetProcAddress(),
eglGetProcAddress(), etc. from the app developer, with very little knowledge
needed on their part. They get to read GL specs and write code using
undecorated function names like glCompileShader().

libepoxy can be used during the build process of xorg-server, and if found in
the system, will be used at build time. This may be used with xorg-server-1.16
or later versions of xorg-server.
