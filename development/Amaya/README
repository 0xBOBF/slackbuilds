Amaya is a Web editor, i.e. a tool used to create and update documents directly
on the Web. Browsing features are seamlessly integrated with the editing and 
remote access features in a uniform environment. This follows the original 
vision of the Web as a space for collaboration and not just a one-way 
publishing medium.

Work on Amaya started at W3C in 1996 to showcase Web technologies in a 
fully-featured Web client. The main motivation for developing Amaya was to 
provide a framework that can integrate as many W3C technologies as possible. 
It is used to demonstrate these technologies in action while taking advantage 
of their combination in a single, consistent environment.

Amaya started as an HTML + CSS style sheets editor. Since that time it was 
extended to support XML and an increasing number of XML applications such as 
the XHTML family, MathML, and SVG. It allows all those vocabularies to be 
edited simultaneously in compound document
