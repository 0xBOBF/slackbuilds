# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

lablgtk: LablGTK (an Objective Caml interface to gtk+/gtk+-2)
lablgtk: 
lablgtk: LablGTK uses the rich type system of Objective Caml 3 to provide a 
lablgtk: strongly typed, yet very comfortable, object-oriented interface to 
lablgtk: gtk+. 
lablgtk: 
lablgtk: It is still under development, but already fully functional. All 
lablgtk: widgets (but one) are available, with almost all their methods. The 
lablgtk: GLArea widget is also supported in combination with LablGL. LibGlade 
lablgtk: and GdkPixbuf support is also included for both versions. LablGTK2 
lablgtk: adds support for gnomecanvas, librsvg and libpanel.
