# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

smc: 
smc: Secret Maryo Chronicles is an Open Source two-dimensional platform 
smc: game with a style designed similar to classic sidescroller games such
smc: as Super Mario Bros. It uses the platform independent library SDL 
smc: and, since version 0.98, the OpenGL accelerated Graphics Renderer. 
smc: The game is developed in C++.
smc: Requires OpenGL (with hardware acceleration), CEGUI (with FreeImage 
smc: or SILLY support), and Boost.  All other dependencies should be in 
smc: stock Slackware.  This package does NOT include the music pack.
