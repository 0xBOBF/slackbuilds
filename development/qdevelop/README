QDevelop is a development environment entirely dedicated to Qt4.
QDevelop is not a Kdevelop-lite; it's an independent IDE dedicated 
to Qt and is totally independent of KDevelop.  Less complete, but 
faster and lighter.  QDevelop and KDevelop have different code sources.

This requires qt4, which is available at SlackBuilds.org.
