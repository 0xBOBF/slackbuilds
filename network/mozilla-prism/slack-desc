# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

mozilla-prism: mozilla-prism (Mozilla Prism Site-Specific Browser)
mozilla-prism:
mozilla-prism: Prism is a simple XULRunner-based browser that hosts web applications
mozilla-prism: without the normal web browser user interface. Prism is based on a 
mozilla-prism: concept called Site-Specific Browsers (SSB). An SSB is designed to 
mozilla-prism: work exclusively with a single web application. It doesn't have the 
mozilla-prism: menus, toolbars and other accoutrements of a traditional web browser.
mozilla-prism: An SSB also offers tighter integration with the operating system and
mozilla-prism: desktop than a typical web application running through a web browser.
mozilla-prism: Applications running in an SSB are therefore able to benefit from many
mozilla-prism: of the advantages of the desktop and of the web at the same time.
