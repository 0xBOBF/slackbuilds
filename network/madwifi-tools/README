MadWifi - a Linux kernel device driver for Wireless LAN chipsets from Atheros.

A wireless card compatibility matrix is available at:
http://madwifi.org/wiki/Compatibility

This SlackBuild builds the madwifi tools, not the kernel module.  You will
need to use the "madwifi-driver" SlackBuild to build the madwifi module for
your kernel version.

Requirements for configuring the wireless card:
  iwconfig -- part of "wireless-tools" package in N series
  wpa_supplicant -- if you use WPA encryption - in N package series
