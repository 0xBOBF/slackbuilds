recoll (personal full text search tool)

Recoll is a personal full text search tool for Unix/Linux.  It is based
on the very strong Xapian backend, for which it provides an easy to use, 
feature-rich, easy administration, QT graphical interface.

This requires xapian-core, with optional dependencies of antiword, unrtf,
and exiftool (all available at SlackBuilds.org).

This version has the ability to define the folders that shall be
indexed from within the program's GUI. Manually editing the config files
should no longer be necessary.
