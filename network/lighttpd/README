lighttpd is a fast, secure, and flexible webserver. It is optimized
for high-performance environments, and provides an extensive feature 
set, including FastCGI, CGI, Auth, output compression, and URL
rewriting support.

By default, this package uses the "lighttpd" user and group to run
lighttpd as a unpriviliged process. The script will exit if these
do not exist on this machine.  We recommend using the following
UID and GID as they do not conflict with any stock Slackware users
and groups, nor with any added by other slackbuilds.org scripts.

    lighttpd
    ========
    User:  lighttpd         UID: 208        GID: 208
    Group: lighttpd                         GID: 208

After that, lighttpd can be started and stopped through the
initialization script that is provided:

/etc/rc.d/rc.lighttpd start
/etc/rc.d/rc.lighttpd stop

If you would like to start lighttpd automatically when the system
is booted, add the following lines to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

    if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.lighttpd ]; then
      /etc/rc.d/rc.lighttpd start
    fi

Conversely, add the following lines to /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown
to stop lighttpd on system shutdown.

    if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.lighttpd ]; then
      /etc/rc.d/rc.lighttpd stop
    fi
