cm_tools are a set of utilities serving as wrappers around the RCS
system. Particularly, they set the checkin timestamps to the
modification date rather than the commit date, along with a few other
differences. They and the directory editor, ded, are designed to work
together.

td_lib (available from SlackBuilds.org) is required to build this. Note
that you do not need to actually 'installpkg' td_lib if you do not want
to. It only needs to be built and when cm_tools is built alongside it,
cm_tools will find it. You can then remove the td_lib directories and
package if you don't want them.

The SlackBuild differs from a default installation in not setting the
set-uid bit on the 'vcs', 'checkin', and 'checkout' binaries. If you
need this, modify the SlackBuild to suit.
