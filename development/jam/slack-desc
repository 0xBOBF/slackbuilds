jam: 
jam: Jam is a program construction tool, like make(1). Jam recursively builds
jam: target files from source files, using dependency information and updating
jam: actions expressed in the Jambase file, which is written in jam's own

jam: provides a boilerplate for common use, relying on a user-provide file
jam: "Jamfile" to enumerate actual targets and sources.
