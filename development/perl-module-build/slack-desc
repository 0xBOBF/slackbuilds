# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

perl-module-build: perl-module-build (Alternative Perl-Module build system)
perl-module-build:
perl-module-build: `Module::Build' is a system for building, testing, and
perl-module-build: installing Perl modules. It is meant to be an alternative
perl-module-build: to `ExtUtils::MakeMaker'. Developers may alter the
perl-module-build: behavior of the module through subclassing in a much more
perl-module-build: straightforward way than with `MakeMaker'. It also does
perl-module-build: not require a `make' on your system - most of the
perl-module-build: `Module::Build' code is pure-perl and written in a very
perl-module-build: cross-platform way.
