plugins-main is the main plugin package for Compiz Fusion. Here, you'll find
our most popular plugins as well as add-ons to the more basic plugins that come
with Compiz Core. Several accessibility-oriented plugins for visually impaired
users are available as well. This package also contains plugins that provide
essential functionality required by other plugins; functionality such as DBUS
inter-process communication, text rendering, and support for various image
formats.

All of the plugins listed here are under active development and are very well
supported by both the developers and the support team.
