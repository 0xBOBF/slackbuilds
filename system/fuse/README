FUSE - Filesystem in Userspace
 
FUSE is a simple interface for userspace programs to export
a virtual filesystem to the Linux kernel. FUSE also aims to
provide a secure method for non privileged users to create
and mount their own filesystem implementations.

NOTE:
- To use FUSE with ntfs-3g, it is necessary to configure it as
a module (--enable-kernel-module), and each time you install
a new kernel(and obviously it's modules), you should rerun this
slackbuild to make a package that fits with the modules of
your new kernel.

- It has a "KERNEL" variable to add it in the name of the final
package, so you can identify the kernel who was used to build
fuse.
