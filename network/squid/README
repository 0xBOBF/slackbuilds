Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients,
supporting FTP, gopher, and HTTP data objects.  Unlike traditional caching
software, squid handles all requests in a single, non-blocking, I/O-driven
process.

Squid supports SSL, extensive access controls, and full request logging.  
By using the lightweight Internet Cache Protocol, squid caches can be 
arranged in a hierarchy or mesh for additional bandwidth savings.

*** NOTE: default paths have changed from prior version ***
If you need the old paths, edit /etc/squid/squid.conf, /etc/rc.d/rc.squid,
and /etc/logrotate.d/squid as needed.

If you need to start squid at boot, make sure /etc/rc.d/rc.squid is
executable and add the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.squid ]; then
	  /etc/rc.d/rc.squid start
	fi

See /usr/doc/squid-3.0.STABLE2/README.SBo for configuration help.
