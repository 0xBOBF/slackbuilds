GMapCatcher is an offline maps viewer. It downloads tiles automatically
from many providers such as: CloudMade, OpenStreetMap, Yahoo Maps,
Google Map. It displays them using a custom GUI. User can view the
maps while offline. GMapCatcher doesn't depend on the map's JavaScript so it
should work even if they change them. It also provides a downloading tool.

GMapCatcher is written in Python 2.6, can run on Linux, Windows and
Mac OSX.
