pekwm is a small and flexible window manager.

The Pek Window Manager is written by Claes Nsten, the code is based on the
aewm++ window manager, but it has evolved enough that it no longer resembles
aewm++ at all. It has a much expanded feature-set, including window grouping
(similar to ion, pwm, or fluxbox), autoproperties, xinerama, keygrabber that
supports keychains, and much more.

 * Lightweight and Unobtrusive, a window manager shouldn't be noticed.
 * Very configurable, we all work and think in different ways.
 * Automatic properties, for all the lazy people, make things appear as
   they should when starting applications.
 * Chainable Keygrabber, usability for everyone.
