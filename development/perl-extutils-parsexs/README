ExtUtils::ParseXS will compile XS code into C code by embedding
the constructs necessary to let C functions manipulate Perl
values and creates the glue necessary to let Perl access those
functions. The compiler uses typemaps to determine how to map
C function parameters and variables to Perl values.

perl-extutils-parsexs requires perl-extutils-cbuilder, which is
also available at SlackBuilds.org.
