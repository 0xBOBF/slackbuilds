# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

davfs2: davfs2 (WebDAV Linux File System)
davfs2: 
davfs2: davfs2 is a Linux file system driver that allows you to mount a WebDAV
davfs2: server as a local file system, like a disk drive. This way 
davfs2: applications can access resources on a Web server without knowing 
davfs2: anything about HTTP or WebDAV.  Davfs2 runs as a daemon in userspace.
davfs2: It uses the kernel file system fuse (or coda, but fuse is in Slack 
davfs2: 12.1 kernel).  To connect to the WebDAV server it makes use of the
davfs2: neon library. Neon supports TLS/SSL using OpenSSL(or GnuTLS, but 
davfs2: Slack has OpenSSL) and access via proxy server.
