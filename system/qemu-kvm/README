KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution
for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions
(Intel VT or AMD-V).  KVM requires QEMU-KVM to create and run virtual
machines (e.g. Windows, Linux, BSD) under full system emulation or user
mode emulation.  QEMU-KVM is a slightly modified QEMU designed to work
with KVM kernel modules.

KVM consists of a loadable kernel module, 'kvm.ko', that provides the
core virtualization infrastructure and a processor specific module,
'kvm-intel.ko' or 'kvm-amd.ko'.  For improved performance QEMU-KVM also
works with 'virtio' modules.  Slackware provides pre-built 'kvm' and
'virtio' modules that work with this package.

This requires a system group (which defaults to 'kvm') which decides who
can use qemu-kvm.  If you want to use a different group, e.g. 'users',
then run the script like this:  KVMGROUP=users sh qemu-kvm.SlackBuild

After package installation, make sure you have the KVMGROUP present on
your system and that all desired users are members of that group.
Don't forget to load the 'kvm-intel' or 'kvm-amd' module, which depends
on your processor.
