Shorewall-Perl (Perl-based compiler for Shoreline Firewall)

The Shoreline Firewall, more commonly known as "Shorewall", is a
Netfilter (iptables) based firewall that can be used on a dedicated
firewall system, a multi-function gateway/router/server or on a
standalone GNU/Linux system.

This is the perl compiler part of Shorewall that allows faster
compilation and execution than the legacy shorewall-shell compiler

You will also need shorewall-common (or shorewall6-common for IPV6 support).
