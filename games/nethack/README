NetHack is a rogue-like game.

This build of NetHack provides the standard console interface as well as the
X11 and Qt interfaces.

The X11 and Qt interfaces as well as the graphical tileset can be enabled via
~/.nethackrc and/or ~/.Xdefaults.  Menu entries are also provided for desktop
enironments that support XDG-style menus.

In order to save games, have scores listed in the top scores, and write to the
nethack logfile, your user must be in the 'games' group.

Additional documentation is provided at /usr/doc/nethack-3.4.3 and via the
nethack manpage.
