SlimServer (network music player)

Slim Devices is a powerful and free Open Source application that will
power any Squeezebox or Transporter but also any software MP3 player 
on your network.

You will need to create a "slimserver" user on the system prior to
installing this package - if the user is not present, then the 
post-install script will print and error and exit.

If you want SlimServer to start at boot, you will need to make the 
/etc/rc.d/rc.slimserver file executable and add the following to 
/etc/rc.d/rc.local:
 if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.slimserver ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.slimserver start
 fi

To setup your SlimServer, open your web browser on the system you installed
SlimServer on and go to http://localhost:9000 to access the web interface.
To tell SlimServer where your music is stored, click the "Server Settings"
link on the left.  You will find a "Music Folder" section to enter the path.

By default, SlimServer will let anyone connect and stream music.  You may
want to check out the Security section and setup a username and password.

You have to register your player with SlimServer before you can start
playing music.  To do that, open the URL http://localhost:9000/stream.mp3
in your music player.  After that you can control everything via the web
interface.  You can down sample the bit rate in the player specific audio
settings.

For more setup info check out the Help section at the bottom of the left
hand panel.  I'll leave the rest for you to explore on your own.  Enjoy!
