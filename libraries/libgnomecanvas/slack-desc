# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libgnomecanvas:
libgnomecanvas: The GNOME canvas is an engine for structured graphics that
libgnomecanvas: offers a rich imaging model, high performance rendering, and a
libgnomecanvas: powerful, high-level API.  It offers a choice of two rendering

libgnomecanvas: another based on Libart, a sophisticated, antialiased,
libgnomecanvas: alpha-compositing engine.  Applications have a choice between
libgnomecanvas: the Xlib imaging model or a superset of the PostScript imaging
libgnomecanvas: model, depending on the level of graphic sophistication
libgnomecanvas: required.
