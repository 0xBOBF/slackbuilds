alltray: With AllTray you can dock any application with no native tray icon
alltray: (like Evolution, Thunderbird, Terminals) into the system tray. A
alltray: high-light feature is that a click on the "close" button will
alltray: minimize back to system tray.  It works well with Gnome,  KDE,
alltray: XFCE 4*, Fluxbox* and WindowMaker*
