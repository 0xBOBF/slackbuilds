This package provides moodbar functionality for Amarok.  It is written as a
plugin for GStreamer.  It attempts to provide a visual representation of your
music so that you can pinpoint where you can find something "interesting."

This package requires GStreamer, GStreamer plugins for any media formats that
you wish to analyze, and a single-precision fftw library.  All of these can be
found on SlackBuilds.org.

To enable moodbars in Amarok, select the "Use moods" option in the general
preferences.
