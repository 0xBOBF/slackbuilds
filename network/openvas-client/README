OpenVAS stands for Open Vulnerability Assessment System and is a network
security scanner with associated tools like a graphical user front-end. The
core component is a server with a set of network vulnerability tests (NVTs)
to detect security problems in remote systems and applications.

OpenVAS products are Free Software under GNU GPL and a fork of Nessus.

This package provides the OpenVAS client. You need GTK libraries and
OpenSSL are highly recommended, both of them are avalaible from Slackware.
