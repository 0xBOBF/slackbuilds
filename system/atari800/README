Atari800 is an Atari 800, 800XL, 130XE and 5200 emulator for Unix, Amiga,
MS-DOS, Atari TT/Falcon, SDL and WinCE. Our main objective is to create a
freely distributable portable emulator (i.e. with source code available).

This build of atari800 uses SDL for graphics/sound, and has no other
dependencies.

To use the emulator, you will need a set of Atari ROM images. Install
the atari800_roms package to get the official (proprietary) ROM images,
or the atari800_os++ package to use an Open Source replacement ROM,
with some loss of compatibility/functionality.

See README_SBo.txt for more information.
