adesklets -  An interactive Imlib2 console for the X Window System

adesklets provides scripted languages with a clean and simple way to write
great looking, mildly interactive desktop integrated graphic applets (aka
"desklets"). It can also be used as a command line oriented graphic editor,
a bit similar to ImageMagick, but with different functionality.

Desklets are not included, they should be downloaded and installed after
installing adesklets

This requires Imlib2, which is also available at SlackBuilds.org.
