DEFCON is a multiplayer simulation of global thermonuclear war,
developed by Introversion. By default the game functions as a demo,
which can be unlocked by buying a license key from Introversion.

In addition to the Linux archive, that is listed in the defcon.info
file, you will need the sounds.dat file for the game to build this
package. This file is available from:
