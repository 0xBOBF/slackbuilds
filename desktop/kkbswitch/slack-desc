kkbswitch:
kkbswitch: KKBSwitch is a keyboard layout indicator for KDE 2 or 3.  It is 
kkbswitch: usefull when you have configured the XKeyboard extension of your 
kkbswitch: X Server to have more than one keyboard group (layout), for example
kkbswitch: US/ASCII and Russian. KKBSwitch displays an icon in the system tray 
kkbswitch: that indicates which layout is currently active.  Note that 
Kkkbswitch: KBSwitch does not help you configure XKeyboard, it merely serves 
kkbswitch: as the indicator of the current layout. You still have to configure
