# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

mppenc: Musepack files. Musepack is an audio compression format with a strong 
mppenc: emphasis on high quality. It is based on the MPEG-1 Layer-2 / MP2 
mppenc: algorithms, but since 1997 it has rapidly developed and vastly 
mppenc: improved and is now at an advanced stage in which it contains heavily 
mppenc: optimized and patentless code.
