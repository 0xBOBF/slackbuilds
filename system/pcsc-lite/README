PC/SC-lite is a middleware to access a smart card using SCard API (PC/SC)
Its purpose is to provide a Windows(R) SCard interface in a very small
form factor for communicating to smart cards and readers.

Compiling with "DEBUGATR=1 ./pcsc-lite.SlackBuild" enables ATR parsing
debug output messages.  Compiling with "APIDOC=1 ./pcsc-lite.SlackBuild"
produces API .pdf documentation (for ifd handlers only, mainly intended
for developers).

pcsc-lite uses libhal for smart-card reader's detection, according to
upstream's advice.  If you want to use usb polling, you can pass "HALD=0"
to the script when building in order to use libusb for detecting your
reader (be aware that, using libusb, if your reader can be managed at
the same time by the openct driver *and* by the pcsc-lite driver, so
you may experience some detection issues).

Please see README.SLACKWARE in pcsc-lite's documentation directory
for notes.
