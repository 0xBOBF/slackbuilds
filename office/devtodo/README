Dev Todo is small command line application for maintaining lists of 
outstanding tasks. It stores tasks hierarchically, with each task 
given one of five priority levels and a matchin colour level.

Data is stored as XML, so various XSLT templates can be executed 
on the XML to convert it into different formats (eg. HTML).

Data is stored in a file named .todo in the current directory. 
Depending on the setting of backup in your configuration file, there 
may also be files named .todo.1, .todo.2, etc. 

Additionally, it can automatically list outstanding items when you change 
into a directory.
