PyQt is the binding of the GUI toolkit Qt.

PyQt is developed by the British firm Riverbank Computing. It is
available under similar terms as Qt, this means variety of licenses
including GPL and commercial license. PyQt supports Linux and other
flavours of Unix, as well as Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows.

NOTE:
This package will, by default, overwrite some files contained in the
stock kdebindings package included in Slackware. To the best of our
knowledge, this is backwards compatible, so there shouldn't be any
adverse effects from the overwritten files, but we cannot make any
promises. If you do encounter problems, remove this pyqt3 package
and reinstall the stock kdebinding package.

This package contains bindings for version 3 of Qt toolkit, and 
requires sip from SlackBuilds.org.
