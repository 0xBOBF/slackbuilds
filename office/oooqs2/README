oooqs2 (OpenOffice.org Quickstarter 2) is a small systray applet for KDE to 
preload OpenOffice.org into memory to make it start faster and designed to 
comply in great parts with its counterpart on Windows systems that is 
delivered with OpenOffice.org. In addition, and that's certainly the most 
important part, it's finally compatible with OpenOffice.org 2.
