PlanetPenguin Racer is an OpenGL racing game featuring Tux, the Linux 
mascot. The goal of the game is to slide down a snow- and ice-covered 
mountain as quickly as possible. It is based on the GPL version of 
TuxRacer. 

You'll need accelerated OpenGL (proprietary ati/nvidia drivers and such)
for this to be usable...
