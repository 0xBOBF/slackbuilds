Glest is a free 3D real-time strategy game, where you control
the armies of two different factions: Tech, which is mainly
composed of warriors and mechanical devices, and Magic, that
prefers mages and summoned creatures in the battlefield.

Requires: glest-data, xerces-c, lua, jam and OpenAL.

Optional build requirements: wxPython.

Optional addons: glest-megapack.

According to the manpage, you should go into the Options menu
and run "Auto config" before the first time you play the game.

If you would like to use the "glest_editor" then pass USE_WX=yes
to the slackbuild.  In order to compile with wxPython pass:
USE_WX=yes ./glest.SlackBuild

Note: This slackbuild will fail if USE_WX=yes and wxGTK is
installed.
