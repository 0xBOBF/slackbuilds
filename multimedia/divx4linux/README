divx4linux (DivX codec for Linux)
Provides the DivX video codec header and libraries for Linux.
http://sourceforge.net/projects/avifile/

This package has no dependencies as it is distributed in binary form. However,
it won't be any use unless you have a media player such as MPlayer to use the
codec.
