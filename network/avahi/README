Avahi is an implementation of the DNS Service Discovery and Multicast 
DNS specifications for Zeroconf Computing. It uses D-BUS for 
communication between user applications and a system daemon. The 
daemon is used to coordinate application efforts in caching replies,
necessary to minimize the traffic imposed on networks. This kind of
technology is already found in Apple MacOS X (branded Rendezvous
Bonjour and sometimes Zeroconf) and is very convenient.

Required dependency libdaemon, which is available at SlackBuilds.org.
Optional dependencies: mono and/or qt4 (also available at 
SlackBuilds.org); enable with MONO=yes QT4=yes ./avahi.SlackBuild

You will need to have an "avahi" user and group on the target system
prior to installing the avahi package.  See README.SBo in this 
directory (it is also installed to the package docmentation directory)
for more information and for setup notes.
