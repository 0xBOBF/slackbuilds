Before executing the script, you will need to create 
a privoxy user and group.  To do that, run the following commands:

  /usr/sbin/groupadd -g 206 privoxy
  
  /usr/sbin/useradd -u 206 -g 206 -c "Web Proxy" \
    -d /dev/null -s /bin/false privoxy

(please note that the \ is just to split the command up, the whole 
'useradd' is one line)

To run privoxy at boot, the following code needs to 
be added to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

 if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.privoxy ];  then
     /etc/rc.d/rc.privoxy start
 fi
