Catfish is a handy file searching tool for linux and unix.
Basically, it is a frontend for different search engines (daemons) which 
provides a unified interface. The interface is intentionally lightweight 
and simple, using only GTK+ 2.  You can configure it to your needs by 
using several command line options.

pygtk (available at SlackBuilds.org) is required to build this package,
nd pyxdg (also available here) is an optional dependency.
