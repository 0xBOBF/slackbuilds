Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick & easy development of user 
interfaces for the Gtk+ toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment. 
The user interfaces designed in Glade are stored in XML format, 
enabling easy integration with external tools.
Other tools are available which can turn the XML files into source 
code in languages such as C++, Perl and Python.
