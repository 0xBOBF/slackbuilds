qTox is a powerful Tox client that tries to follow the Tox design guidelines
while running on all major platforms.

NOTE: At the time of writing, upstream is getting prepared to migrate everything 
to the new Tox API. In the meantime, and until everything is in place for this 
change, we are going to use a specific git revision to communicate successfully
with older clients.
