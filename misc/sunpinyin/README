SunPinyin is a statistical language model based Chinese input method, which was
firstly developed by Sun Beijing Globalization team.

Just like fcitx, you can build it into a stand alone XIM program. If you do not
want the XIM sunpinyin, set EN_XIM=no (EN_XIM=no sh ./sunpinyin.SlackBuild).
This SlackBuild will build the XIM program by default. If building XIM program,
this package will have /etc/profile.d/sunpinyin.{csh,sh} to setup the envs. Set
them to be executable if you want them take effect or vice versa.

Also, this package have a wrapper called ibus-sunpinyin which enables user to
use SunPinyin with IBus framework. You can build it with EN_IBUS=y. If you want
to use this wrapper, make sure you have ibus installed before building.

If you disable both IBus wrapper and XIM program, this package will end up with
"useless" stuffs such as docs and translations. Take care ;)
