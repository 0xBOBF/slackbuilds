Xscrabble project is an internationalized version of the Xscrabble 
program. It is an enhancement of Matt Chapman's original Xscrabble
which is a networked scrabble implementation for the X Window System.  

Among other things, version 2 adds internationalization features.  English 
and French are currently supported (the dictionary files should be downloaded 
separately from the main package).  You must have at least one of the 
dictionary files present when building the package; obtain them here:
