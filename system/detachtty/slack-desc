 HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

detachtty: detachtty (a screen like program)
detachtty:
detachtty: detachtty lets you run interactive programs non-interactively, and
detachtty: connect to them over the network when you do need to interact with
detachtty: them. It's designed for long-running Lisp processes. Unlike screen,
detachtty: it works in emacs comint modes, and unlike qcmu, it deals correctly
detachtty: with passing on a SIGINT sent to it. Needs ssh for operation over
detachtty: the net.
