JACK is a low-latency audio server, written primarily for Linux. It can
connect a number of different applications to an audio device, as well
as allow them to share audio among themselves.  Its clients can run in
their own processes (ie. as a normal application) or they can run within
a JACK server instance (i.e. as a "plugin").

Jack uses /dev/shm as a temporary directory for its processes; this is a
relatively new change, as it used to use  /mnt/ramfs. You may pass an
alternate location as JACKTMP when executing the script. For example:
	JACKTMP=/mnt/tmp jack-audio-connection-kit.SlackBuild
Assuming you use the default /dev/shm as temporary directory, be sure you
have an appropriate line in /etc/fstab to mount it:
	tmpfs		/dev/shm	tmpfs	defaults	0 0
If you don't accept the script's default, you'll need to have the appropriate
mountpoint set up in fstab and mounted, but a discussion of how to do that
is outside the scope of this document.

jack optionally uses libsndfile which is also available at SlackBuilds.org.
