This script builds sshfs-fuse, a SSH "client" that integrates with FUSE
to allow you secure, encrypted file-system level access to files and
directories on any server to which you have ssh access.

Naturally, this script requires FUSE to be at all useful.  You can
pickup a SlackBuild script for fuse from here:
