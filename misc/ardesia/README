Ardesia turns your screen into a digital sketchpad to annotate or draw
on the entire screen.  It also lets you record and stream it on the
network with vlc.  You can draw upon the desktop or import an image
as well as annotate and redistribute it.  Ardesia is also pressure
sensitive assuming your device is properly configured.

USER TIPS:
Ardesia is set to be 'always on top' and will be on top of even desktop
panels.  However, if you have shortcuts too or launch the program with
'-d' you can toggle the 'always on top' option and the panel should
be back on top.  This will allow you to opperate at least operate the
panel as well as minimize ardesia to regain full control over the
desktop.  Personally, they should of had a 'pass through' mode so that
you would not have to hide the panel or the drawings to do things on
the desktop.

The PDF export will allow you to add new pages to a pdf that are screen
captures of when the button is pressed. It does not save vector shapes.

Fluxbox and Blackbox are not compatible! The program will draw
black over everything and not allow you to access the tools the same
goes for curtain and spotlighter (maintained by ardesia).  Openbox 
works without issues.  You are on your own testing other minimalist
window managers.

This requires gsl.
