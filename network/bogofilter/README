Bogofilter is a Bayesian spam filter. In its normal mode of operation, it
takes an email message or other text on standard input, does a statistical
check against lists of "good" and "bad" words, and returns a status code
indicating whether or not the message is spam.  Bogofilter is designed with
fast algorithms (including Berkeley DB system), coded directly in C, and tuned
for speed, so it can be used for production by sites that process a lot of
mail.

Bogofilter can be built with different database backends. Default is
Berkeley DB available in Slackware (db44 and older versions). You can use
sqlite3 instead, available from slackbuilds.org, by setting the DATABASE
environment variable.

Once the package is installed, there is good documentation available in
the standard location.
