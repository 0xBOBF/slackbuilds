Sx is a reliable, fully distributed cluster solution for your data storage
needs. With Sx you can aggregate the disk space available on multiple servers
and merge it into a single storage system. The cluster makes sure that your data
is always replicated over multiple nodes (the exact number of copies is defined
by the sysadmin) and synchronized.

Additionally Sx has built-in support for deduplication, client-side encryption,
on-the-fly compression and much more.

To start immediately, read the quickguide!

NOTE 1: Everything needed by sx and not in the system will be built statically.
        If you prefer (like me) system libs get yajl and fcgi from SBo.
        Also sqlite3 3.8.4.3 can be linked dinamically but you must compile it
	by source (target the lib64 if x86_64 is your system arch).

NOTE 2: To build only a client, uncomment the ONLY_CLIENT parameter in
        skylable-sx.SlackBuild.
