xtables-addons (additions for iptables/xtables)

Xtables-addons is the proclaimed successor to patch-o-matic(-ng). 
It contains extensions that are not in the main Xtables package,
including TARPIT and SYSRQ.

This package builds some kernel modules, so it will need to be
rebuilt any time you change kernels.

Don't write to the maintainer asking for this to be updated;
version 1.12 is the last version that will build on Slackware 12.2
due to the version of iptables (1.4.2) that it shipped.
