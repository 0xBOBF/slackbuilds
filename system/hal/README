HAL - Hardware Abstraction Layer

You will need to create the 'haldaemon' user and group and the 'plugdev' and
'power' groups before installing the hal package; sample lines to do so are:
  /usr/sbin/groupadd -g 82 haldaemon
  /usr/sbin/groupadd -g 83 plugdev
  /usr/sbin/groupadd -g 84 power
  /usr/sbin/useradd -c 'HAL daemon' -g haldaemon -u 82 -d '/' -s /bin/false haldaemon

Note that the numerical uid and gid given in the above sample lines may need 
to change on your system; if you already have an existing user and/or group 
with those id's, then they obviously need to be modified for your system.  
Because the 'haldaemon' user and group and the 'plugdev' and 'power' groups 
are considered system accounts, the custom is to make their uid's and gid's 
less than 100, but that's entirely up to you.

After creating the required users and groups and installing the package,  
you will need to make sure the /etc/rc.d/rc.hald script is run at boot. 
The easiest way to do this is adding something like the following line to 
/etc/rc.d/rc.local:

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.hald ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.hald start
  fi

Note that hald must be started after the messagebus service (dbus), and be
sure to move or merge both of the .new files installed by this package
(if they already existed): 
  /etc/dbus-1/system.d/hal.conf.new and /etc/rc.d/rc.hald.new

You will also want to stop the hald service at shutdown; that can be done
by adding the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown (note that this 
should happen before the messagebus service is stopped):

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.hald ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.hald stop
  fi

We patch the included /etc/dbus-1/system.d/hal.conf to use the following 
group memberships:
  power -- shutdown/restart/suspend/hibernate
  video -- graphics adapter and display power management
  plugdev -- mounting filesystems
You can change these settings by editing the file.

Dependencies: dbus, dbus-glib, 2.6.x kernel-headers (Use headers in /extra),
  and hal-info    Optional dependency: dbus-qt3 (if you want to use with kde)

Also note that kde (or xfce) will need to be recompiled it you want them to
use HAL.  We do not in any way support the recompiling of stock Slackware 
packages, so you're on your own with that.  

DO NOT REPORT BUGS TO PAT IF YOU'RE USING THIS!  We hope that it's stable
and secure enough for regular use, but if it breaks, you get to keep all of
the pieces...
