abcde is a frontend command-line utility (actually, a shell script)
that grabs tracks off a CD encodes them to Ogg/Vorbis, MP3, FLAC,
OGG/Speex, and/or MPP/MP+(Musepack) format, and tags them, all in one
go.

abcde requires cd-discid, which is also available at SlackBuilds.org.
If you want to have mp3 encoding capability, you need to install the
lame package (lame is also available at SlackBuilds.org).

There are many more features that abcde supports that you can add on, such as
mkcue and encoding in other various formats, see the man page for more info.
Try running abcde as root (sudo or whatever) if abcde/cd-discid thinks your
favorite audio cd is a data cd.
