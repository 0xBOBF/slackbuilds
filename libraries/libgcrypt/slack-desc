libgcrypt: Libgcrypt (cryptographic library)
libgcrypt:
libgcrypt: This is a general purpose cryptographic library based on the code
libgcrypt: from GnuPG.  It provides functions for all cryptograhic building
libgcrypt: blocks: symmetric ciphers (AES, DES, Blowfish, CAST5, Twofish,
libgcrypt: Arcfour), hash algorithms (MD4, MD5, RIPE-MD160, SHA-1, TIGER-192),
libgcrypt: MACs (HMAC for all hash algorithms), public key algorithms (RSA,
libgcrypt: ElGamal, DSA), large integer functions, random numbers and a lot of
libgcrypt: supporting functions.
