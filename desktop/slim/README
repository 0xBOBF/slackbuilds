Slim is a lightweight login manager based on GNUstep's Login.app
It makes a great replacement for XDM for those who want something
that looks good, but still do not want Gnome or KDE.

This package also includes a BSD-style rc.d script to start slim;
you will need to make /etc/rc.d/rc.slim executable:
   chmod 755 /etc/rc.d/rc.slim
Also, you will need to add something like this to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.slim ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.slim start
  fi
